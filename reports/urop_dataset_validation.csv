in dense consolidation in the right posterior lung and right perihilar 
node, possibly tumor recurrence.
2. Increase in size and number of sclerotic osseous metastases since prior 
CT of **DATE[MM DD 2012], however PET CT demonstrates decrease in FDG uptake 
and increase in sclerosis of osseous lesions compared with prior PET CT of 
**DATE[MM DD 2012], consistent with treatment response in that interval.
3. Stable nonspecific bilateral pulmonary nodules are not FDG avid.

**DATE[MM DD 2013] MRI total spine
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Nonsmall cell lung cancer.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI total spine without and with intravenous contrast, protocol 
#14. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axialT1-weighted and T2-weighted 
images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were 
obtained. 
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2012] MRI total spine,  Outside MRI of the lumbar 
spine from **DATE[MM DD 2012].
 
FINDINGS: 
 
SPINE:   The study particularly the axial images through the cervical and 
upper thoracic spine is slightly limited by motion artifact. There is 
rotatory cervicothoracic scoliosis, with persistent but stable mild 
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 on a degenerative basis. There is preservation 
of the vertebral body heights. There be related fatty marrow is identified 
involving the midthoracic vertebrae. Multilevel multifocal sclerotic 
osseous metastases within the C7, T1,  L1, L2, L3, vertebral bodies and in 
the right medial iliac bone are again noted. A small focus of sclerotic 
osseous metastatic disease along the anterior/inferior aspect of the T12 
vertebral body has slightly progressed in size when compared to **DATE[MM DD 
2012], now measuring 1.1cm in greatest AP dimension, previously 0.5 cm.  
The lesion along the right aspect of the L2 vertebral body has slowly 
progressed in size since **DATE[MM DD 2012], now measuring 2.1 x 1.7 cm, 
previously 1.6 x 1.4 cm.
 
There is no definite epiduraldisease or paravertebral mass component. 
There is normal caliber and signal of the spinal cord, without cord 
compression or cord edema. There is no definite plaquelike or nodular 
enhancement along the surface of the spinal cord or cauda equina to 
suggest leptomeningeal disease. There are advanced multilevel degenerative 
changes with disc osteophyte complexes abutting the ventral cord at C3/4 
through T1/T2, and 
 
Again noted moderate spinal canal stenosis at L2-L3, L3-L4 broad-based
disc bulges at L2/3, L3/4, L4/5, and L5/S1, which cause moderate spinal 
canal stenosis at L2/3, L3/4, and L5/S1.  The patient is status post 
interval interval lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5 level for the previously 
noted severe spinal canal stenosis based on the anterolisthesis and disc 
bulge in conjunction with facet joint hypertrophy. Expected postoperative 
change is noted including mild postoperative fatty atrophy of the left 
posterior paraspinous musculature with no significant residual impingement 
of the cauda equina fibers. There remains bilateral neural foraminal 
stenosis at these levels, that is worst at right L4/5 based on a 
combination of facet hypertrophic change and posterior disc osteophyte 
formation.
 
OTHER:  No suspicious masses in the visualized portions of the posterior 
fossa.  Pleural-parenchymal change in the right lungs are better evaluated 
on dedicated imaging.      
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM DD 2012] MRI total spine,
1. Interval laminectomy at L4-L5 to relieve the previously noted severe 
spinal canal stenosis and compression of the cauda equina with expected 
postoperative change, persistent nor foraminal stenosis at this level is 
based on a combination of broad-based disc bulges, facet joint 
hypertrophy, and  mild anterolisthesis. 
2. Again noted multifocal sclerotic osseous metastases in the spine and 
right medial iliac bone,  the majority of which are stable, several have 
slightly progressed in size over time since **DATE[MM DD 2012] as described 
above. No definite new metastatic lesions are identified.
3. No significant epidural or paravertebral component, spinal cord 
compression, or compression fracture. No evidence for leptomeningeal 
disease.
4.  Advanced multilevel degenerative changes, with disc osteophyte 
complexes abutting the cervical spinal cord, as well as again noted 
moderate to severe narrowing of the spinal canal at L2/3, L3/4, and L5/S1.

associated compressive left lower lobe consolidation, either atelectasis 
or infectious/ inflammatory infiltrate. No change in loculated small right 
pleural effusion
2.  Persistent groundglass infiltrates in the left upper and lower lobes, 
probably infectious/ inflammatory.
3.  Slight decrease in size of peripheral left upper lung mass, possibly 
secondary to slice selection differences.
4.  Other findings are unchanged in this short-interval follow-up CT.
 
A preliminary version of these results were discussed with PA **NAME[WWW VVV] 
at 4:20 PM on **DATE[MM DD 2013] by the resident on call.

**DATE[MM DD 2013] : Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer.  Patient is referred for restaging.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.8 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 63 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery STE-BR PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral     contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for thisPET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 154 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

**DATE[MM DD 2013]; MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung carcinoma.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: The ventricles are normal in size and shape. There are slight 
patchy scattered foci of white matter hyperintensity on the long TR 
images. The finding is nonspecific but probably related to chronic 
microvascular ischemia. There is a small left basal ganglia chronic 
lacunar infarct. Small bilateral cerebellar chronic infarcts are also 
demonstrated. There is no evidence of acute infarction, intracranial 
mass-effect or midline shift. The post gadolinium images demonstrate no 
definite evidence of enhancing parenchymal mass lesions to suggest 
metastatic disease to the brain. Approximately 1 cm focus of faint 
enhancement within medial right temporal lobe with slight associated 
susceptibility artifact and no edema probably represents a capillary 
telangiectasia.Followup would be helpful to ensure stability.
 
OTHER:    There are small bilateral maxillary mucous retention cysts, 
right greater than left.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
1 cm enhancing lesion within medial right temporal lobe probably 
represents a capillary telangiectasia. Followup is suggested to ensure 
stability.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer.  Evaluation of extent of disease.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 13.2 mCi F-18 FDG
 
TECHNIQUE:  Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 58 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 710 PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state.   Oral     contrast material was 
administered for the CT scan. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study 
is designed for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET 
abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot 
replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging 
protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 124 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

Addendum Begins
The findings of patchy right basilar consolidations (pneumonia or 
pneumonitis) were discussed with Dr. **PHYS_NAME on **DATE[MM DD 2013] at 3 PM. As 
per Dr. **PHYS_NAME, patient had radiotherapy to the right hilum completely in 
**DATE[MM 2013]. Therefore, right paramediastinal consolidation described in 
the report is consistent with radiation-induced change.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 376 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2013] and PET CT dated may 8, 2013
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:         Most comparisons are done to PET/CT 
because right lung was partially obscured by pleural effusion on **DATE[MM DD 
2013] study. Bilateral upper lobectomies. Unchanged since **DATE[MM DD 2013] and 
improved since **DATE[MM DD 2013] faint ground glass opacity in the left lower 
lobe, site of prior metastasis. Now poorly delineated/difficult to measure 
right pulmonary metastases with new relatively confluent right 
paramediastinal consolidation. Since **DATE[MM DD 2013], new patchy probably 
infectious consolidations in the right lung base.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Interval right pleural catheter placement. 
Substantially decreased now trace loculated right hydropneumothorax. 
Persistent mild right pleural thickening. Increased small pericardial 
effusion.
 
THORACIC NODES:           Limited evaluation due to lack of intravenous 
contrast.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:          unremarkable
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  Increased since **DATE[MM DD 2013] small metastasis in the 
right scapula. Stable probably benign sclerotic lesion in the right 
proximal humerus.
 
OTHER:                                Right chest wall port with its tip 
in the right atrium.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1.  Unchanged since **DATE[MM DD 2013] and improved since **DATE[MM DD 2013] faint 
ground glass opacity in the left lower lobe, site of prior metastasis.
2.  Now poorly delineated/difficult to measure right pulmonary metastases 
with new relatively confluent right paramediastinal consolidation.

inlet to the pubic symphysis after oral and intravenous contrast 
administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 899 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                No interval change in the appearance 
of the lungs, status post bilateral upper lobectomies. Geographic 
paramediastinal consolidation with traction bronchiectasis on the right is 
again related to radiation therapy. There is persistent airspace 
consolidation with interstitial thickening at the right lung base. Focal 
groundglass in the left upper lobe is stable.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Small loculated right pleural effusion is stable with 
right pleural thickening. Trace pericardial fluid is also unchanged.
 
THORACIC NODES:      Left supraclavicular adenopathy is new and measures 
1.3 x 1.0 cm. Right pericardial lymph adenopathy is new and measures up to 
1.2 x 1.1 cm. A 1.6 x 1.1 cm in mediastinal lymph node previously measured 
1.2 x 1.2 cm. 1.3 x 0.9 cm right retrocrural lymph node previously

KIDNEYS:                            Punctate low-density left renal focus 
remains too small to characterize.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:  Clustered lymph nodes in the upper 
abdomen are mildly increased. For example, a 2.0 x 1.6 cm peripancreatic 
lymph node previously measured 1.3 x 0.9 cm. A 0.7 cm celiac axis lymph 
node previously measured 0.5 cm. Subcentimeter lymph nodes persist in the 
left retroperitoneum. Subcentimeter clustered lymph nodes in the mesentery 
are unchanged.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Prostatic hypertrophy
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     Unremarkable
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Increased lytic metastasis of the left L3 vertebral 
body measuring 2.9 x 2.5 cm, previously 2.2 x 1.9 cm. Similar increase in 
metastasis at L5 measuring 1.4 x 1.4 cm, previously 1.0 x 1.0 cm and right 
scapular metastasis measuring 2.0 x 1.7 cm, previously 1.5 x 1.3 cm. 
Sclerosis persists in the right humeral head.
 
OTHER:                              Slight increase in enhancing mass 
along the subcutaneous right chest wall measuring 1.4 x 1.0 cm, previously 
1.0 x 0.6 cm. Right central venous catheterterminates in the SVC
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2013], no change in the appearance of the lungs, status 
post bilateral upper lobectomies and right radiotherapy. Stable airspace 
consolidation with interstitial thickening at the right lungbase, 
differential considerations include infectious/inflammatory or 
lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
2.  New adenopathy in the left supraclavicular and mediastinal regions 
with increased adenopathy in the upper abdomen.
3.  Increased lytic osseous metastases.
4.  Increased chest wall mass.
5.   Stable small loculated right effusion and right pleural thickening.

**DATE[MM DD 2013]; MRI brain lab full
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of lung mass and brain lesions suspicious for 
metastases diagnosed at an outside institution.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI full brain lab without and with intravenous contrast, 
protocol #2, using sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial 
susceptibility-weighted, FLAIR, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and 
diffusion tensor images; axial ADC and exponential ADC maps; 
contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; 
contrast-enhanced thin-section and 3**NAME[M] axial T1-weighted images; and 
dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images with 3**NAME[M] postprocessing 
performed on an independent workstation.
 
COMPARISON: There are no prior dedicatedimaging studies of the brain 
currently available for comparison.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
There is a 16 x 14 mm heterogeneously enhancing metastasis in the 
anteroinferior right parietal lobe associated with moderate amount of 
edema. The lesiondemonstrates precontrast T1 hyperintense signal and 
prominent blooming artifact on the susceptibility weighted images 
consistent with internal blood products. The perilesional edema extends to 
the right frontoparietal region. The corresponding perfusion color maps 
demonstrate elevated Ktrans (permeability) and plasma volume.   A smaller 
ring-enhancing metastasis measuring 6 x 5 mm in the anterior paracentral 
left parietal lobe is associated with minimal edema (series 7, image 25). 
Subcentimeter enhancement in the left frontal lobe (series 16, image 22; 
series 18, image 8; series 17, image 20) probably represents a prominent 
cortical vein rather than metastasis but attention on followup is 
recommended.
 
Scattered T2 hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter are nonspecific 
but probably secondary to chronic microvascular ischemia. There is no 
acute infarction, hydrocephalus, midline shift, or acute hemorrhage.
 
OTHER: The nasopharynx and **NAME[WWW]'s cave are within normal limits. There 
are no suspicious expansile or infiltrative marrow lesions in the 
calvarium and skull base.
 
IMPRESSION: Baseline MRI brain at MSKCC:
Partially hemorrhagic right parietal lobe metastasis measuring up to 16 mm 
and high left parietal lobe metastasis measuring up to 6 mm.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
Previously described enhancing hemorrhagic metastasis in the right medial 
parietal lobe has decreased in size in comparison to prior exam, measuring 
5 mm (previously measured 7 mm) and the surrounding vasogenic edema has 
resolved. A small enhancing metastatic lesion is again seen in the high 
left posterior frontal lobe, minimally decreased in size in comparison to 
prior exam. Scattered foci of increased signal on T2/FLAIR sequences are 
seen and likelyrepresents post treatment change or microvascular ischemic 
disease. There are no other new enhancing lesions.
There is no evidence of acute infarction. There is no extra-axial fluid 
collection.
 
OTHER:
 
There are no expansile or destructive osseous lesions. The right mastoid 
effusion is noted.

**DATE[MM DD 2014]; MRI brain with T1 perfusion
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Brain metastasis status post RT. Lung cancer.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images; and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images with 3**NAME[M] 
postprocessing performed on an independent workstation.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Right posteroinferior paramedian parietal metastasis demonstrates 
increased surrounding enhancement. The enhancing region measures 2.2 x 2 
cm. Only minimal enhancement is seen on the prior MRI examination. Mild 
new surrounding edema is also noted which extends into forceps major and 
splenium of the corpus callosum. Small component of the lesion 
demonstrates slight hyperperfusion. The finding probably represents 
radiation necrosis.
The treated superficial metastasis within medial left high parietal lobe 
has remained stable. Background white matter changes are stable. There are 
no new enhancing mass lesions orhydrocephalus.
 
 
IMPRESSION:  Compared to **DATE[MM DD 2014];
1. Increased right parietal metastasis with new surrounding edema is 
probably related to radiation necrosis. Continued followup is suggested.
2. No new brain metastasis.

exponential ADC maps; contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images; and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images with 3**NAME[M] 
postprocessing performed on an independent workstation.
 
COMPARISON: Multiple studies including the most recent prior brain MRI 
performed on **DATE[MM DD 2014].

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
The heterogeneously enhancing, partially necrotic and somewhat stellate 
mass in the inferomedial right parietal lobe has increased measuring 27 x 
21 mm, previously 22 x 20 mm. There is increased moderate surrounding 
edema tracking to the centrum semiovale with involvement of the posterior 
frontal lobe, splenium of the corpus callosum, and occipital lobe without 
midline shift or herniation. The majority of the lesion does not 
demonstrate substantially elevated plasma volume.
 
The contracted enhancing subcentimeter lesion in the parasagittal anterior 
left parietal lobe (series 14, image 16) is unchanged. There is no 
evidence of new intracranial metastatic disease, acute hemorrhage, 
hydrocephalus, or acute infarct. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic 
changes are noted in the cerebral white matter.
 
OTHER:
The nasopharynx is within normal limits.
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM DD 2014];
Further increase in size of the heterogeneous and partially necrotic 
inferomedial right parietal mass probably representing evolving radiation 
injury. Stable contracted subcentimeter lesion in the left parietal lobe.

Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images; and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images with 3**NAME[M] 
postprocessing performed on an independent workstation.
 
COMPARISON: MRI brain of **DATE[MM DD 2015]
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: The heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the right medial parietal 
lobe has slightly contracted and measures 2.2 x 1.9 cm from 2.5 x 2.0 cm, 
though withslightly increased edema extending into the right high 
parietal lobe and right posterior corpus callosum. The enhancing lesion 
along the left high parasagittal parietal lobe is slightly larger, now 
measuring 0.8 x 0.5 cm on image 25 series 12 from 0.6 x 0.4 cm with 
slightly increased edema. There is no focal hyperperfusion in either of 
the enhancing lesions, though the more cephalad smaller lesion is not 
fully included in the perfusion sequence.
 
No definite new suspiciously enhancing brain lesions or mass effect. No 
acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarct, or extra-axial collections. 
Chronic patchy background white matter changes are otherwise stable. 
Ventricles are stable without hydrocephalus.
 
OTHER: Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2015], continued slight contraction of the heterogeneously 
enhancing lesion in the right medial parietal lobe, without 
hyperperfusion, but with slightly increased surrounding edema. This is 
thought to represent evolving post radiation changes.
 
Continued slight increase in size of the subcentimeter enhancing lesion in 
the left parasagittal parietal lobe. No definite hyperperfusion is seen 
within, and this may also represent evolving radiation changes and is 
amenable to continued follow-up.

TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 60 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the BAIC DVCT with the 
patient in the fasted state. Oral and intravenous contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 91 mg/dl.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] MRI brain with T1 perfusion
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer with lung metastases
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images; and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images with 3**NAME[M] 
postprocessing performed on an independent workstation.
 
COMPARISON: MRI brain of **DATE[MM DD 2016]
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: The heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right medial parietal 
lobe on image 16 series 13 is relatively stable in size, though associated 
of thin-walled cysts around its margins have increased in size, and for 
instance the cyst along the superior aspect now measures 2.1 cm from 1.5 
cm on coronal image 9 series 12, while the 2 anterior cysts are now 2.1 cm 
combined from 1.6 cm on image 12 series 12.  There is improved but still 
elevated perfusion within the nodular enhancement. The contracted 
heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the left paramedian frontoparietal 
lobe junction on image 25 series 13 is stable, and this lesion is not 
included on perfusion imaging. Surrounding hyperintense T2/flair signal 
edema is stable or minimally improved.  There remains irregular 
susceptibility artifact within both lesions compatible with chronic 
hemosiderin deposition or mineralization.
 
No definite new suspiciously enhancing brain lesions or mass effect. 
Scattered patchy punctate nonenhancing white matter lesions are otherwise 
stable. The ventricles are stably prominent. No midline shift or downward 
herniation. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarct, or new extra-axial 
collections.
 
OTHER: Patchy effusions in the right mastoid air cells are stable and the 
paranasal sinuses and left mastoid air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2016], heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the left 
paramedian frontoparietal lobe and right medial parietal lobe are stable, 
though with increased cystic changes around the periphery of the right 
sided lesion which may be related to evolving treatment/reactive changes. 
No definite new or worsened brain metastasis or acute intracranial 
abnormality.

**DATE[MM DD 2013] MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weightedand diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: Outside MRI brain from **DATE[MM DD 2013]
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: There is subtle punctate enhancement in the right medial parietal 
lobe on image 10 series 10 without edema or mass effect which may 
represent a treated metastasis, and by report a right parietal metastasis 
with irradiated in 2011. No definite suspiciously enhancing brain lesions 
or new mass effect identified. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarct, 
or extra-axial collection. No midline shift or downward herniation. Stable 
ventricles without hydrocephalus. Minor patchy chronic background white 
matter changes are stable.
 
OTHER: Mastoid air cells are clear. There is increased opacification in 
the left maxillary sinus with slightly increased inflammatory mucosal 
changes in the paranasal sinuses without fluid levels. There is 
hypointensesignal within the partially visualized C5 vertebral body on 
image 13 series 3 it, although this area is not well evaluated on this 
scan. An osseous metastasis there is not excluded.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2013], no definite brain metastasis or acute intracranial 
abnormality.
 
Possible lesion within the C5 vertebral body which is not well imaged but 
with an osseous metastasis there not excluded. Correlation with bone scan 
may be helpful.

 **DATE[MM DD 2013] Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer.  Patient is referred for followup after 
treatment.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.8 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 68 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-B PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral and intravenous contrast 
material was administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is 
designed for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET 
abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot 
replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging 
protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 94 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

**DATE[MM DD 2013]; CT neck
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of metastatic lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: CT neck with intravenous contrast, protocol #11, using axial 
images and coronal and sagittal reformations.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 806.96mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: There are no prior dedicated imaging studies of the neck 
currently available for comparison.
 
FINDINGS:
 
SOFT TISSUES:     There are no asymmetric mucosal contour deformities or 
discrete enhancing masses concerning for malignancy in the oral cavity, 
pharynx and larynx. A small calcification in the anterior left palatine 
tonsil is probably related to an old infectious/inflammatory process. The 
pterygopalatine fossae, masticator and parapharyngeal spaces are clear. 
There are no suspicious lesions in the submandibular, left parotid and 
thyroid glands. There are several subcentimeter nodes/nodules in the 
superficial right parotid gland. There is also a peripherally enhancing 
and centrally cystic/necrotic lesion measuring 9 x 8 mm posterior to the 
right parotid gland and medial to the earlobe (series 2, image 30).
 
NODES:                 There are predominantly subcentimeter bilateral 
cervical nodes which appear reactive. There is a minimally enlarged left 
level VA lymph node (series 2, image 59) measuring 11 x 6 mm. This has not 
significantly changed in size since the **DATE[MM DD 2013] FDG PET/CT scan and 
is also probably reactive.
 
OTHER:                 There is atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid 
bifurcations and proximal internal carotid arteries, greater on the right, 
without evidence of high-grade stenosis. See separately reported CT chest 
examination performed on the same date for evaluation of the thorax.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Predominantly subcentimeter and reactive appearing cervical nodes 
bilaterally. A minimally enlarged 11 mm left level VA lymph node is not 
significantly changed since the PET scan performed in **DATE[MM 2013] and is 
probably also reactive.
2.  Small asymmetric right parotid nodes/nodules and a centrally 
necrotic/cystic 9 mm node/nodule in the right posterior auricular region. 
These are nonspecific but possibly secondary to an infectious/inflammatory 
process with metastases notexcluded but considered less likely. Clinical 
correlation is recommended.

protocol #13**NAME[M]. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and 
T2-weighted images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted 
images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE: An expansile metastasis is seen centered within right posterior 
aspect of L5 vertebral body measuring 3.3 x3 cm on the axial images. 
There is moderate epidural disease which extends into the right neural 
foramen and effaces right ventral aspect of the thecal sac as well as the 
right lateral recess. The epidural component impinges on right L5 and to a 
lesser extent S1 nerve roots.
 
A 1.6 x 1.7 cm left paraspinal mass at lumbosacral junction abuts the 
medial aspect of postganglionic left L5 nerve root. This nodule likely 
represents a metastatic node.
 
The vertebral body heights and alignments are maintained. Mild to moderate 
degenerative changes are seen without high-grade central canal stenosis. 
Small annular fissure at L4-L5 level indents the ventral aspect of the 
thecal sac.
 
The conus is normal in signal intensity and morphology with its tip at L1 
level. There is no evidence of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement.
 
OTHER: There are bilateral adrenal mass lesions consistent with metastases.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
Expansile L5 vertebral body metastasis with epidural and right foraminal 
extension impinging on right L5 and to a lesser extent S1 nerve roots.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Squamous cell Lung cancer. Probable brain metastases. 
Patient is receiving chemotherapy.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axialT1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2013], **DATE[MM DD 2013] MRI brain
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Of the 2 previously identified tiny superficial enhancing probable 
metastases within left frontal lobe and  tiny enhancing lesion within the 
left occipital lobe as identified on MR brain dated **DATE[MM DD 2013] only the 
left frontal opercular lesion remains barely appreciable on current scan 
as faint ill-defined and probably peripheral enhancement on series 9 image 
23. No additional new foci of brain parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural 
enhancement are identified. Stable mild patchy scattered foci of white 
matter hyperintensity on the long TR images are nonspecific but likely 
represent chronic microvascular ischemia. There is no evidence of acute 
infarction.
 
OTHER:    There isnonspecific background marrow heterogeneity without 
expansile or destructive marrow infiltrative lesions. . Stable size and 
morphology of the diffusion positive nodule within the left preauricular 
soft tissues is unchanged since prior exam and demonstrates T2 signal 
hyperintensity with a hemosiderin rim and no discernible enhancement, 
probably representing a sebaceous cyst.
 
IMPRESSION Since **DATE[MM DD 2013] MRI brain
2 of the 3 previously identified tiny enhancing probable metastasized 
lesions in the left frontal and occipital lobes respectively remain other 
unappreciable on current exam, interval decrease in conspicuity of the 
remaining tiny peripherally enhancing probable metastatic lesions within 
left frontal lobe.
 
No definite new metastases.

COMPARISON: There are no prior dedicated imaging studies of the brain 
currentlyavailable for comparison.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
There is no mass effect, acute hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or acute 
infarction. Several small and nonspecific T2 hyperintensities in the 
cerebral white matter are probably secondary to mild chronic microvascular 
ischemic disease. A small dural based enhancing lesion overlying the 
lateral left parietal lobe measuring up to 5 mm (series 11, image 23; 
series 10, image 5; series 9, image 13) probably represents an incidental 
meningioma. There is no suspicious intracranial enhancement suggestive of 
metastases.
 
OTHER:
There are no expansile or infiltrative marrow lesions to suggest bone 
metastases in the calvarium and skull base
 
IMPRESSION:
Subcentimeter dural based lesionoverlying the lateral left parietal lobe 
probably represents a benign incidental meningioma. No evidence of 
intracranial metastases.

**DATE[MM DD 2014]; MRI cervical spine
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of lung cancer and right hand weakness.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI cervical spine without and with intravenous contrast, 
protocol #13A. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and 
T2-weighted images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted 
images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: There are no prior dedicated cross-sectional imaging studies 
of the cervical spine currently available for comparison.
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE:
Vertebral body heights are maintained. There are no suspicious expansile 
or infiltrative marrow lesions to suggest bone metastases. The 
postcontrast images do not demonstrate any suspicious intramedullary, 
leptomeningeal, or epidural enhancement, allowing for mild vascular 
enhancement along the surface of the cord.
 
There is 2 mm anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and reversal of the normal 
cervical lordosis. There is desiccation of the intervertebral discs with 
advanced loss of disc height at C4/C5, C5/C6 and C6/C7. There are also 
disc bulges at these levels which efface the ventral CSF but do not 
compress the cord. There is mild degenerative foraminal narrowing at 
multiple levels.
 
OTHER:
There are multiple parenchymal metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema 
within both cerebellar hemispheres measuring up to 23 mm on the right and 
17 mm on the left.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of osseous, epidural, or leptomeningeal metastasis within 
the cervical spine.
2. Multiple cerebellar metastases measuring at least up to 2.3 cm with 
surrounding vasogenic edema; correlation with dedicated brain imaging is 
recommended.
3. Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine without 
high-grade or foraminal canal compromise

measures 22 x 17 mm. There is mild to moderate multifocal parenchymal 
edema throughout the brain without midline shift or herniation.
 
There is mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease in the cerebral white 
matter. There is no acute infarction or acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
Several lesions demonstrate low signal on the susceptibility weighted 
images suggesting internal blood products and/or mineralization.
 
A subcentimeter incidental meningioma overlying the anterior left parietal 
lobe (series 9, image 14) is unchanged.
 
OTHER:
The nasopharynx is within normal limits.
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM DD 2013];

thickening in the right middle and lower lobes. Right upper lobe anterior 
paramediastinal mass extending from the apex to the minor fissure, 
measuring 7.1 x 1.8 cm, which is inseparable from probable paramediastinal 
fibrosis. This area is FDG avid on prior PET/CT from **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Interval pleurodesis with new associated high density 
pleural foci and decreased right pleural effusion, now small. Stable 
loculated right pleural effusion along the major fissure.

masslike collapse and consolidation, centered on the lingula, extending 
through oblique fissure into left lower lobe. Mass contains areas of low 
density, probably necrosis, and extendsto pleura laterally and hilar 
medially. Tumor encases left upper bronchi with secondary obstruction, 
limiting accurate measurement of the mass discrete from adjacent collapsed 
lung. A representative area of the mass measures 7.6 x 6.2 cm, previously 
7.3 x 4.6 cm. Tumor encases left pulmonary arterial tree, with secondary 
narrowing of left upper lobe pulmonary artery.
 
Increasing adjacent, left basal satellite nodules, including 0.4 cm 
nodule. Multiple new right lung nodules, most prominent within right 
middle lobe measuring up to 0.6 cm. New interlobular septal thickening 
within left upper and lower lobes.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Enlarging, small, loculated left pleural effusion. 
Enlarging, moderate pericardial effusion.

inlet to the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 206.76 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: CT chest and abdomen **DATE[MM DD 2014] .
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                 Left perihilar mass involves both 
the left upper lobe/lingula and left lower lobe and measures at least 8.1 
x 5.2 cm previously 6.1 x 5.8 cm. However without IV contrast enhancement 
I cannot distinguish between true mass versus postobstructive atelectasis 
or consolidation. Compared to prior scan there is increasing peribronchial 
soft tissue thickening within the left upper lobe especially evident 
medially. Partial right middle lobe atelectasis particularly within the 
medial segment is new. A subpleural nodule anteriorly in the right upper 
lobe now measures 1.0 x 0.9 cm previously seen as a pleural-based nodule 
which measured 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:  New large right pleural effusion. Small residual left 
pleural effusion secondary to an indwelling pleural drainage catheter 
coiled at the left lung base. Marked decrease in size of pericardial 
effusion, now small..
 
THORACIC NODES:           Right paratracheal node is 1.3 x 1.2 cm 
previously 1.8 x 1.6 cm. There are high right paratracheal nodes as well 
though poorly evaluated on this noncontrast scan. Left anterior 
mediastinal nodes measure up to 1.3 x 1.0 cm and are stable. 2.1 x 1.7 cm 
subcarinal node was 2.1 x 1.4 cm.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:          Unremarkable.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  Sclerotic lesions within the T5-T6 and T7 vertebrae 
are stable as is sclerotic change around an area of subchondral cyst 
formation at the inferior aspect of T10 vertebra. Small sclerotic lesion 
in the lateral manubrium on the right is stable since prior scan. All 
areas of sclerosis are new since the scan of **DATE[MM DD 2013]. Slight 
compression of the T7 vertebral body is stable from prior scan but was not 
present on **DATE[MM DD 2013]. No additional osseous metastasis.
 
OTHER:      None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014] enlarging mass in the left perihilar region 
involving the upper and lower lobes compared to prior scan. Without IV 
contrast enhancement cannot distinguish extent of mass from 
postobstructive consolidation or atelectasis. There is also an enlarging 
right upper lobe nodule and new partial right middle lobe atelectasis.
2.  New large right pleural effusion. Decreased left pleural effusion with 
an indwelling pleural drainage catheter.There is also decreased 
pericardial effusion.
3.  Persistent mediastinal adenopathy might be slightly smaller but is 
difficult to evaluate accurately on this noncontrast scan.
4.  No adrenal mass.
5.  Sclerotic lesions within the thoracic spine in the right side of the 
manubrium or possibly healed metastases and are unchanged from **DATE[MM DD 
2013]. None of these were evident on the scan of **DATE[MM DD 2013]. Slight 
compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body is stable since **DATE[MM DD 
2014] which was not present on **DATE[MM DD 2013].

CLINICAL STATEMENT:      NSCLC. Ordering MD: **NAME[YYY ZZZ CCC: M]/S  
WHY? EOD  REASON: Reason For Study:Other - (Please Specify);   Patient is 
referred for restaging.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.9 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 68 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 600 PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral and intravenous contrast 
material was administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is 
designed for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET 
abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot 
replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging 
protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 88 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV)are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

TECHNIQUE:  Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 60 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the D600 with the patient 
in the fasted state.   Oral     contrast material was administered for the 
CT scan. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 123 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                There aremultiple new and enlarging 
rounded bilateral pulmonary nodules. Enlarging left basilar 0.5 x 0.4 cm 
nodule was previously punctate measuring 1-2 mm, while representative new 
left apical nodules include a 0.5 x 0.4 cm nodule and slightly more 
superior 0.2 cm nodule. Representative right lower lobe 0.7 x 0.60 nodule 
may have been obscured by effusion previously.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Right pleural effusion has nearly resolved with areas 
of high attenuation in multiple high-density pleural-based nodules on the 
right. The high attenuation may reflect post-pleuracentesis material. 
Punctate left pleural-based nodules are also noted along the fissure 
without pleural effusion. Trace pericardial effusion is noted.
 
THORACIC NODES:         Left supraclavicular/superior paratracheal 1.4 x 
1.1 cm adenopathy is new. Few scattered small nonenlarged axillary nodes 
are noted, left greater than right.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              0.6 x 0.3 cm too small to characterize segment
4A low density superiorly is noted. There is slightly rounded gallbladder 
fundal wall focal thickening (not previously imaged) measuring up to 7 mm 
in thickness. There is no surrounding fat stranding. There is vascular 
shunting between the left portal vein and left hepatic vein suggesting 
vascular malformation.
 
SPLEEN:                            unremarkable

PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     No bowel obstruction or ascites.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Lytic destructive right posterior ninth rib lesion 
with pathologic fracture is new. This covers an approximately 3 cm extends 
probably involving adjacent pleura. Multiple areasof vague left iliac 
sclerosis correspond to regions of FDG avidity..
 
OTHER:                               none
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since imported remote CT chest **DATE[MM DD 2009], multiple new 
bilateral pulmonary nodules and enlarging previously punctate left basilar 
nodule, suspicious for metastases.
2.  Although right pleural effusion has nearly resolved with apparent 
post-pleuracentesis changes, numerous right greater than left 
pleural-based nodules are noted, suspicious for metastases.
3.  Findings consistent with osseous metastases including destructive 
right 9th rib lesion with associated pathologic fracture, as well as left 
iliac lesions.
4.  New left supraclavicular and upper retroperitoneal left para-aortic 
adenopathy.
5.  Probable benign focal gallbladder fundal adenomyomatosis and left 
hepatic vascular malformation.

mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-B PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral     contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 93 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

OTHER STUDIES USED FOR CORRELATION: CT chest, abdomen, pelvis **DATE[MM DD 
2014]
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, extraocular muscles, large salivary 
glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                        Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool and myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     Numerous bilateral pulmonary 
nodules, some FDG avid. The cluster of nodules with tree in bud appearance 
in the right midlung has slightly improved, FDG uptake in nearly resolved.
 
There are mixed changes in other pulmonary nodules: some have resolved or 
decreased, but some have newly developed. For instance, a cluster of 2 or 
3 nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 0.7 cm, with SUV 6.7, is 
new. On the other hand, several other subcentimeter nodules in the left 
lung resolved. Similar mixed changes are noted in the right lung.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       Patient is status post a right pleurodesis with 
and dense material along the pleural linings and heterogeneous FDG uptake, 
probably indicating inflammatory granulomatous reaction. A small basal 
right pleural effusion is new.
 
No left pleural effusion or pericardial effusion, no abnormal uptake here.
 
THORACIC NODES:                Mixed changes in thoracic lymph nodes. 
Increase in size and/or intensity is seen in left axillary nodes 
(subcentimeter, SUV 7.9, prior 4.9), prevascular nodes,. Unchanged FDG 
avid lymph nodes in the left internal mammary region, subcarinal region, 
lower retrosternal region in the right supradiaphragmatic region.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     Persistent hypermetabolic nodule in 
segment 2 (SUV 4.3, prior 5.8). New subcapsular lesion in segment 5-6 
(image 147), and a 2 new hypermetabolic lesions in segment 7 posteriorly, 
the larger with SUV 13.9. Liver background SUV mean, as a reference for 
comparing FDG studies, is 2.0, prior 1.9.
 
SPLEEN:                              No abnormal uptake
 
PANCREAS:                              Probably normal
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                Probably normal
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Excreted activity is seen inthe 
bilateral kidneys and in the urinary bladder
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  Hypermetabolic lymph nodes again seen in the upper 
abdomen and retroperitoneum. Representative measurements are
1.  Left paraortic at level of the renal vessels, SUV 10.5, prior 12.2
2.  To the right side of the proximal superior mesenteric artery, image 
134, SUV 8.3, prior 3.3
3.  Anteriorly to the neck of the pancreas, SUV 5.1, prior 2.7
4.  Lower retroperitoneal lymph nodes appear slightly less intense.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             Intestinal activity is probably in 
the range of normal variation, possibly intense uptake related to 
metformin medication.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No clearly abnormal uptake

BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          Increase in size and intensity of a lytic 
lesion in the ninth right rib posteriorly, SUV 25.6, prior 13.7, now with 
near total destruction of the and extension into the chest wall externally 
and along right pleurain terminal lead. The largest transaxial diameter, 
this mass now measures about 8.1 x 5.2 cm, previously about 2.2 x 2.2 cm.
 
Diffusely elevated uptake throughout the bone marrow, possibly due to 
anemia or G-CSF administration. Nevertheless, there are some new and 
increasing areas of more focal uptake consistent with metastases in pelvic 
bones, spine, sternum and some ribs. Representative lesions include
1.  Left posterior iliac bone, SUV 14.1, prior 6.3
2.  Right anterior iliac crest, SUV 8.8, prior 2.4
3.  Posterior aspect of L1, SUV 7.3, prior 4.3

PET CT scan **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                The patient's known carcinoma in the 
posterior segment of the right upper lobe laterally is 2.6 x 1.5 cm and 
was 2.2 x 1.5 cm on the PET CT scan of **DATE[MM DD 2013]. Since the prior 
scan as the patient has undergone thoracoscopy, pleurodesis andbiopsy on 
the right. There is now extensive consolidation and atelectasis within the 
right lower lobe. Masslike opacity at the confluence of the major and 
minor fissures on the right is probably related to scarring as well rather 
than tumor. No mass in the left lung.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: There is minimal residual pleural effusion on the 
right. High attenuation within the pleural space is consistent with talc 
pleurodesis. There is also irregular pleural thickening within the minor 
fissure consistent with pleurodesis. No pleural effusion on the left and 
no pericardial effusion..
 
THORACIC NODES:         A high right paratracheal node is 1.4 x 1.0 cm 
previously 0.9 x 0.5 cm. Nodes within the AP window and left subaortic 
space are mildly enlarged with the left subaortic node now 1.8 x 1.3 cm 
previously 1.5 x 1.0 cm.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              No hepatomegaly and no biliary dilatation. 
Tiny nonspecific low-attenuation lesion within segment 2 is 0.6 cm. 
Additional tiny lesion within segment 4A is 0.2 cm and nonspecific.

NODES:                              no adenopathy
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            unremarkable
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     The gastric fundus appears somewhat thick walled and 
has a similar configuration to the prior scan. However this may be a 
phasic due to a peristaltic contraction and correlation on followup scans 
is suggested.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: unremarkable
 
OTHER:                               none
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2013] possible minimal enlargement of the patient's 
known lung cancer in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
2.  New consolidation and atelectasis in the right lower lobe status post 
right thoracoscopy and pleurodesis. High attenuation material is 
consistent with talc pleurodesis.
3.  2 tiny lesions in the left hepatic lobe are nonspecific.
4.  No adrenal mass.
5.  Possible mild mural thickening along the gastric fundus though this 
may be a phasic due to a peristaltic contraction. Suggest comparison on 
followup scan.

PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: No effusion. Right irregular pleural thickening   is 
not significantly changed.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Increased right axillary lymph nodes 
which now demonstrate loss of fatty hila. One lymph node measures 1.4 x 
1.0 cm increased from 0.7 x 0.5 cm, these changes are better appreciated 
on coronal images.  A subpectoral lymph node measuring 0.9 x 0.6 cm
increased from previous 0.5 x 0.4 cm.

significantly changed since the prior exam, now measuring now 1.5 x 1.2 
cm; however  it increased since **DATE[MM DD 2014] when it measured 0.7 x 0.6 
cm. The lesion was not present on **DATE[MM DD 2014]. Overall sclerotic 
lesions increased in number compared to prior exams of 2014 and most 
likely represent metastases. Wedge compression deformities of mid thoracic 
vertebral bodies are unchanged.

which now demonstrate loss of fatty hilum, possibly metastatic. Left 
supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes are essentially stable, one lymph 
node however decreased in size. Unchanged mediastinal and right hilar 
mildly enlarged lymph nodes.
 
Gradual increase in size of left adrenal gland, which demonstrates 
enhancement and is possibly metastatic.
 
Comparison to multiple prior exams demonstrates increased number of 
sclerotic bone lesions since 2014, these probably represent metastases.
 
Stable right pleural thickening. Stable subpleural consolidation in the 
medial aspect of right lower lobe Overall patient may benefit from PET CT 
to evaluate for tumor activity.

administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 611.15 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: Submitted PET CT scan **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                Large right apical mass is 4.7 x 3.5 
cm and extends to the superior sulcus. There is probable mediastinal tumor 
invasion as tumor directly abuts the right lateral wall of the trachea 
with subtle contour deformity and possible mural invasion. Additional 
scattered nodules are seen along the minor fissure onthe right all 
measuring under 1 cm. These were present on the prior PET CT scan. Partial 
atelectasis of the right lower lobe secondary to the adjacent right 
pleural effusion. No nodules within the left lung. A peripheral ground 
glass opacity laterally in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe 
is 1.3 x 0.9 cm and nonspecific.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Decreased right pleural effusion compared to prior 
scan secondary to the indwelling right pleural drainage catheter. Fine 
nodularpleural mass with enhancement is consistent with pleural 
metastases. This is seen at the right apex as well as along the posterior 
chest and right lung base. No discrete pleural mass seen in the left 
chest. No pleural effusion on the left and no pericardial effusion.
 
THORACIC NODES:         There is right hilar adenopathy with a node 
measuring 2.4 x 1.8 cm probably unchanged from prior study but not well 
measured as the prior scan was obtained without IV contrast enhancement. 
Right paratracheal node is 1.8 x 1.1 cm. There is a small subcarinal node. 
A high right paratracheal node is 0.7 x 0.7 cm.
 
Of note are bilateral low attenuation thyroid nodules, some showing 
calcification in the right. Right lobe is enlarged.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              No hepatomegaly and no biliary dilatation. 
Subcentimeter low-attenuation lesion laterally within segment 2/3 (series 
2 image 51) is 0.5 x 0.3 cm and indeterminate. Gallbladder is unremarkable.
 
SPLEEN:            Resected
 
PANCREAS:                      Unremarkable.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:        Normal appearance of the right adrenal gland. 
Thickening of the limbs of the left adrenal gland is stable. This was not 
FDG avid on the recent submitted PET CT scan.
 
KIDNEYS:                            No mass or hydronephrosis in either 
kidney.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              no adenopathy
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Uterus and adnexa are in situ.
 
PERITONEUM/

left paracolic gutter.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: unremarkable
 
OTHER:                               none
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since PET CT scan **DATE[MM DD 2013], interval enlargement of a right 
apical mass extending to the superior sulcus and probably invading the 
mediastinum and directly abutting the trachea. There is subtle mass effect 
upon the trachea with suspicion for possible tracheal wall invasion. This 
is associated with ipsilateral right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy 
consistent with metastatic disease.
2.  Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion with an indwelling 
pleural drainage catheter. There are pleural metastases and associated 
right lower lobe compressive atelectasis secondary to the effusion. Tiny 
nodules along the minor fissure are stable. Left lung remains clear.
3.  Subcentimeter indeterminate lesion within hepatic segments 2/3.
4.  Normal appearance of the right adrenal. Thickening of the limbs of the 
left adrenal gland was not FDG avid on the recent submitted PET CT scan.

Stable left paramediastinal postradiation fibrotic changes, stable, and 
representing the area previously noted to have focal increased FDG uptake, 
which probably reflects post radiation inflammatory changes, less likely a 
developing recurrence. New posterior left lower lobe patchy groundglass 
opacities, probably infectious/inflammatory. Unchanged 0.4 cm nodular 
opacity in the posterior left lower lobe. Unchanged right upper lobe 
groundglass opacity.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: No effusion.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung adenocarcinoma status post left upper lobectomy, 
chemotherapy and radiation. Evaluate extent of disease.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.6 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 66 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-A PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oralcontrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 124 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUV max) in a given 
disease site.

left mediastinal radiation with left upper paramediastinal parenchymal 
consolidation with cicatrization bronchiectasis and straight lateral 
marginconsistent with post radiation fibrosis and unchanged from prior 
study. New dense consolidation posteriorly at the right lung base is 
probably infectious/inflammatory. A 0.8 x 0.7 cm ground glass opacity in 
the right upper lobe is unchanged (series 3 image 12) since **DATE[MM DD 2010]. A 
faint peripheral subpleural thickened bronchiole in the right lower lobe

decreased from prior scan.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         A large precarinal node is 4.3 x 3.0 
cm previously 4.1 x 2.0 cm. This was markedly FDG avid on the PET/CT of 
**DATE[MM DD 2015]. Right axillary mass is 2.7 x 1.6 cm enlarged from 1.7 x 
1.2 cm and was FDG avid previously. Two additional right axillary nodes 
measure 2.2 x 1.4 cm and 1.1 x 0.9 cm and are newly enlarged since prior

ADRENAL GLANDS:        Normal appearance of the right adrenal gland. New 
left adrenal mass is 2.1 x 1.9 cm consistent with a metastasis.
 
KIDNEYS:                            No hydronephrosis in either kidney. 
There are bilateral low-attenuation masses which are possibly cysts and 
are slightly larger. None of these were FDG avid on the PET CT scan. The 
largest in the left kidney is 3.3 x 2.5 cm and the largest in the right 
kidney is 2.4 x 2.3 cm. There are 2 soft tissue nodulesin the left 
perinephric space, including a 0.5 x 0.5 cm nodule medial to the upper 
pole of the kidney and a 1.7 x 1.4 cm mass adjacent to the lower pole of 
the left kidney. Lower pole mass was FDG avid previously when it measured 
0.5 cm. A third mass in the left posterior pararenal fat laterally is 1.1 
x 1.0 cm (series 2A image 68) ,and was not seen previously.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Prostate is enlarged with marked impression upon 
the base of the urinary bladder.

**DATE[MM DD 2014]; MRI total spine
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of metastatic lung cancer and new-onset lower back 
pain for approximately one week
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI total spine without and with intravenous contrast, protocol 
#14. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were 
obtained.
 
COMPARISON: There are no prior dedicated cross-sectional imaging studies 
of the spine currently available for comparison.
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE:
There is a peripherally enhancing osseous lesion in the left L5 vertebral 
body adjacent to the superior endplate measuring 16 x 14 mm on axial 
imaging. This is suspicious for metastatic disease. There are no definite 
osseous metastases within the remainder of the spine. There is mildly 
heterogeneous background T1 hypointense signal within the marrow without 
any suspicious hyperintense lesions on the inversion recovery sequence 
probably representing hematopoietic elements in the setting of 
anemia/therapy effects. Vertebral body alignment is maintained. There is 
minimal concavity of the left superior L5 vertebral body endplate, 
otherwise heights are maintained. The postcontrast images do not 
demonstrate any suspicious intramedullary, meningeal, or epidural 
enhancement.
 
There are posterior disc bulges at C4/C5, C5/C6 and C6/C7. The disc bulge 
at C5/C6 results in mild to moderate degenerative cord flattening. There 
is slight indentation of the cord at C4/C5 and C6/C7. Varying degrees of 
foraminal narrowing are also noted at these levels. There is no 
significant disc bulging or herniation the lumbar spine.
 
OTHER:
Note is made of supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A 
partially imaged right lung mass is identified. There is abnormal 
thickening of the right adrenal gland suspicious for metastatic disease. 
The kidneys demonstrate a horseshoe configuration with fullness of the 
collecting system.
 
IMPRESSION:
Osseous lesion within the left L5 vertebral body suspicious for 
metastasis. No evidence of epidural or leptomeningeal disease. Additional 
findings as above.

COMPARISON: Outside PET/CT of **DATE[MM DD 2014] and outside chest CT of 
**DATE[MM DD 2014]
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                Poorly defined central right hilar 
mass is associated with partial consolidation and atelectasis of the right 
upper lobe and right middle lobe. Subjectively the involvement appears to 
be increased. Encasement of right upper lobe bronchi and to a lesser 
extent right middle lobe bronchi is present. Some nodular and thickened 
septal markings are seen in the upper right upper lobe.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: No effusion.
 
THORACIC NODES:         Adenopathy is noted at the lower neck and 
supraclavicular areas. Confluent adenopathy at the left supraclavicular 
area measures 1.9 x 1.7 cm, previously 1.2 x 0.7 cm. Adenopathy is noted 
at multiple mediastinal locations. For example a right superior node 
measures 1.5 x 1.3 cm, previously 1.5 x 1.2 cm, a right paratracheal lymph 
node measures 1.8 x 1.1 cm, previously 1.7 x 0.8 cm, a right infrahilar 
node measures 2.8 x 1.8 cm, previously 2.8 x 1.6 cm, a lower right 
posterior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.2 cm, previously 1.4 x 1.2 cm. 
Other mediastinal and right hilar nodes are present.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              A solid nodule is noted at segment 4 measuring 
1.3 x 1.2 cm, previously 0.9 x 0.7 cm. A subcentimeter hepatic segment 6 
nodule is present which cannot be compared due to technical artifacts 
present on the prior examination. No biliary duct dilatation is present.
 
SPLEEN:                            Unremarkable.
 
PANCREAS:                      Unremarkable.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:        Right adrenal nodular thickening measures 2.8 x 0.9 
cm, previously 2.8 x 0.7 cm. A new small left adrenal nodule is noted 
measuring 1.3 x 0.6 cm.
 
KIDNEYS:                            There is a horseshoe kidney. No 
hydronephrosis is present. An extrarenal type renal pelvis is noted on the 
left.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              No adenopathy.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            The urinary bladder is unremarkable. 
Postoperative findings are seen at the upper scrotum bilaterally.
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:    Unremarkable.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: A lytic focus in the left side of the L5 vertebral 
body has increased. A lytic focus at the medial upper right iliac bone has 
also increased. A possible lesion versus degenerative change at the upper 
sacrum appears unchanged.
 
OTHER:                               None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], central right hilar pulmonary mass consistent 
with lung neoplasm with associated consolidation and atelectasis at the 
right upper lobe and right middle lobe subjectively appears increased. 
Nodular thickened septal markings in the upper right upper lobe is 
suspicious for lymphangitic component.
 
2.  Interval increase of metastasis at hepatic segment 4.  A small segment 
6nodule is suspicious for metastasis.
 
3.  A right adrenal nodule is stable and a new small left adrenal nodule 
has developed. These are suspicious for metastases.
 
4.  Lytic metastases involving L5 and the right iliac bone have increased.
 
5.  Adenopathy in the lower neck and thorax is present at multiple 
locations with some areas that have slightly increased and other areas 
which have remained stable.

**DATE[MM DD 2014] CT of chest
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Dyspnea. Lung cancer. Evaluate for pneumonia or 
pneumonitis.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 444 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS: Increased consolidation with air bronchograms and near total 
collapse of the right upper lobe probably representing a combination of 
ill-defined tumor and postobstructive atelectasis. Ill-defined soft tissue 
mass extending from the right hilum into the right upper lobe and along 
the right lower lobe segmental bronchi, probably representing 
peribronchovascular tumor extension. Absence of intravenous contrast 
limits further evaluation. Right greater than left subsegmental 
atelectasis. Unchanged nonspecific perifissural nodularity along the left 
major fissure.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: New small right pleural effusion with mild pleural 
nodularity posteriorly, suspicious for metastases. No left pleural 
effusion. Small pericardial effusion.
 
THORACIC NODES: No substantial change in size of left lower 
neck/supraclavicular adenopathy. For example, an unchanged node left 
supraclavicular node measures 2.4 x 1.2 cm and an additional left 
supraclavicular node which is not substantially changed measures 1.4 x 1.1 
cm. Mediastinal adenopathy, some of which is unchanged, some of which is 
increased. For example, an unchanged high right paratracheal node measures 
1.4 x 1.2 cm while a increased size lower right paratracheal node measures 
1.6 x 1.3 cm, previously 1.4 x 1.2 cm and a paraesophageal nodal 
conglomerate measures 2.9 x 1.9 cm, previously 2.2 x 1.6 cm.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS: Unchanged.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Unchanged.
 
OTHER: None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], increased consolidation in the right upper lobe 
probably representing a combination of increased ill-defined tumor and 
post obstructive atelectasis / pneumonia. Further evaluation is limited 
due to absence of intravenous contrast.
2.  Increased soft tissue extension along right lower lobe segmental 
bronchi, probably representing peribronchovascular tumor extension.
3.  Mediastinal adenopathy, some of which is increased while some is 
unchanged with stable left supraclavicular/left lower neck adenopathy.
4.  Other findings are unchanged in this short-interval follow-up CT.

4.2 cm, previously 5.0 x 3.5 cm at a similar level. More inferiorly, this 
measures 3.9 x 2.2 cm, previously 3.8 x 2.1 cm. Differences in 
measurements are probably artifactual, as lesion is difficult to measure, 
and appears overall similar to prior study. Nodule adjacent to the minor 
fissure is unchanged, 0.8 cm. Cystic changes of COPD, and left base linear 
scarring stable.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Focal left anterolateral apical pleural thickening 
adjacent to left upper lobe mass. No pleural effusion. No pericardial 
effusion.

unchanged, 1.5 x 1.2 cm, previously 1.6 x 1.1 cm, although additional 
upper abdominal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic lymph nodes are decreased. 
For example, portacaval lymph node currently measures 2.8 x 0.9 cm, 
previously 3.4 x 1.7 cm. Left para-aortic lymph node measures 1.1 x 0.8

**DATE[MM DD 2014] MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: headache  Lung, primary Please do Sellar cuts. Concern 
for hypophysitis. Also, patient with blood behind Left tympanic membrane.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained. Additional postcontrast and axial and 
coronal T1-weighted sequences were obtained through the sella region.
 
COMPARISON: MRI the head dated **DATE[MM DD 2014]. I have also looked at a 
earlier MRI of the head dated **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: There is ventricular and sulcal prominence that is within normal 
limits for a patient of this age. There is focal and confluent 
predominantly periventricular-periatrial white matter hyperintensity as 
seen on long TR sequences which is nonspecific though not entirely 
atypical in a patient of this age, possibly representing the sequela of 
small end vessel disease, chronic ischemia. Therapy related white matter 
change may be contributing to this appearance.In any event the white 
matter changes have remained stable when compared to the earlier study. 
There is no evidence of an acute infarct on the diffusion-weighted 
sequences and flow void is preserved within the larger intracerebral 
vessels. There are no hematomas or extra-axial collections. There is no 
hydrocephalus. There is no abnormal parenchymal or meningeal enhancement 
to suggest other brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.
 
The sella and suprasellar region are unchanged. The cavernous sinus has a 
normal appearance. Thin sections through the sella demonstrate normal 
appearing enhancement of the pituitary infundibulum which does not appear 
to be enlarged and which has not changed in caliber. Minor deviation of 
the pituitary stalk to the left is unchanged and is felt to be related to 
slight sloping of the floor of the sella. No pituitary mass is evident. 
The optic chiasm is normal in position. The hypothalamus has a normal 
appearance. There is no evidence of infiltration of the central basal 
skull-clivus.
 
No suspicious appearing osseous lesions are identified.
 
OTHER: There is new minor opacification of several mastoid air cells on 
the left compared to the MRI the head from **DATE[MM DD 2014]. The left 
mastoid is otherwise unremarkable on this MRI of the brain.
 
IMPRESSION:
 No brain metastasis or evidence of leptomeningeal disease.
 
No evidence of hypophysitis
 
No significant interval change from **DATE[MM DD 2014].

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer. Followup after radiation therapy to C7.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI total spine without and with intravenous contrast, protocol 
#14. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were 
obtained.
 
COMPARISON: Compared to the only available prior MRI of the spine, a study 
from an outside institution of the cervical spine dated **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE:
 
When compared to the prior studies there has been improvement in the 
appearance of the metastasis involving the posterior left side of the C7 
vertebral body with extension into the posterior elements. On the current 
study, there is no evidence for residual epidural extension. There is some 
possible mild compromise of the left C6-C7 neural foramina.
 
No other suspicious areas for metastases are identified. A chronic 
appearing anterior wedge compression fracture is identified of T12. This 
is probably benign in etiology. Mild rotatory scoliosis is identified in 
the lumbar spine. Degenerative changes are seen in the posterior facet 
joints, worst at L4-L5.
 
The degenerative changes in the cervical spine are not appreciably changed.
 
OTHER:
 
There is no evidence for abnormal signal intensity or enhancement of the 
cord or the leptomeninges.
 
A large right lung mass is identified which represents the primary 
neoplasm. Bilateral renal metastases are seen.
 
IMPRESSION:
Since **DATE[MM DD 2014]:
1. Improvement in the left C7 metastasis with no evidence for epidural 
extension.

**DATE[MM DD 2014] MRI total spine
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer. Followup after radiation therapy to C7.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI total spine without and with intravenous contrast, protocol 
#14. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were 
obtained.
 
COMPARISON: MRI total spine **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], there has been probable slight improvement in the 
appearance of the metastasis involving the posterior left side of the C7 
vertebral body with extension into the posterior elements. There is no 
evidence for residual epidural extension. There is stable mild compromise 
of the left C6-C7 neural foramen.
 
No new suspicious osseous lesions are identified. A chronic appearing 
anterior wedge compression fracture of T12 is again seen, probably benign 
in etiology. Mild rotatory scoliosis is again identified in the lumbar 
spine. Stable degenerative changes are seen in the posterior facet joints, 
worst at L4-L5.
 
No abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement is seen. No evidence of malignant 
cord compression.
 
The degenerative changes in the cervical spine are not appreciably changed.
 
OTHER:
 
Right lung mass, adrenal lesions, and abdominal lymphadenopathy are best 
characterized on body CT **DATE[MM DD 2014]. Stable T2 hyperintense lesion in 
the right hepatic lobe and bilateral T2 hyperintense renal lesions noted.
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM DD 2014],
Probable slight improvement in the left C7 metastasis. No new suspicious 
osseous lesions.

**DATE[MM DD 2015] MRI total spine
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Metastatic lung cancer with lower back pain and 
C-spine lesion
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI total spine without and with intravenous contrast, protocol 
#14. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were 
obtained.
 
COMPARISON: MRI total spine of **DATE[MM DD 2014]
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE: The study is slightly limited by motion and pulsation artifact.
 
There is improvement of the infiltrating signal abnormality within the 
left C7 vertebral body, though with slightly increased edema of the 
anterior superior T1 vertebral body and to a lesser extent of the anterior 
inferior C7 vertebral body. There remains heterogeneity of the C7 
vertebral body consistent with treatment effects. There is minimal stable 
prevertebral edema again noted about the cervicothoracic junction seen on 
the STIR sequence. Stable alignment of the spine with stable reversal of 
the cervical curvature. Stable moderate compression deformity with 
anterior wedging of T12. No definite new compression fractures. No 
definite new suspicious marrow signal abnormality or epidural or 
paravertebral mass.
 
Normal caliber and signal of the spinal cord without cord compression, 
cord edema, or leptomeningeal disease. Multilevel degenerative changes are 
stable without high-grade spinal canal stenosis.
 
OTHER: Visualized posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. Right lung 
nodule, and nodularity of the adrenals, can be better correlated with 
dedicated body imaging.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], evolving treatment changes about the C7 level, 
with increased endplate edema/signal abnormality about the anterior C7/T1 
disc space, which is thought to represent evolving treatment or 
inflammatory / degenerative changes rather than metastatic disease and 
amenable to attention on follow-up scan. No definite new spine metastasis, 
compression fracture, cord compression, or leptomeningeal disease.

FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                The linear opacity in the right apex 
and the postoperative changes in the right upper lobeare stable. Again 
visualized is collapse of the left upper lobe due to obstruction of the 
left upper lobe bronchus by a hilar mass. There is increased collapse of 
the left lower lobe.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: There is increase in the left-sided pleural effusion 
with mild left to right mediastinal shift. Findings are suspicious for a 
tension hydrothorax. The previously described left pleural nodularity is 
not well appreciated on this study likely secondary to lack of IV contrast 
administration.

**DATE[MM DD 2014] Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung, primary CA (162.9). Ordering MD: **NAME[YYY XXX] 
**NAME[ZZZ] PROT: 11-189 WHY? Evaluate extent of disease REASON: Follow-up.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.6 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 94 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690 PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral and intravenous contrast 
material was administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is 
designed for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET 
abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot 
replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging 
protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 87 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.
 
COMPARISON FDG PET/CT: **DATE[MM DD 2014]
 
OTHER STUDIES USED FOR CORRELATION: CT of **DATE[MM DD 2014] and other prior 
imaging .
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                  Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, extraocular muscles, large salivary 
glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool and myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     The dominant left upper lobe 
perihilar mass has increased in size and FDG avidity compared to prior 
imaging and measures 4.0 x 3.8 cm previously 3.1 x 2.5 cm, SUV max is 
20.4, previously 11.6. Additionally there are multiple new FDG avid foci 
in the left lung, for example:
- Peripherally in the left of the upper lobe SUV max 8.3
- Left lung apex SUV max 6.7.
- Peripherally in the left lower lobe SUV max 9.0
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       There is diffuse FDG uptake of the left pleura 
with focal areas of thickening and intense FDG uptake; for example, 
lateral to the aorta SUV max 9.8. There is FDG avid pleural fluid. Left 
chest pain/tube in place. Small pericardial effusion.
 
THORACIC NODES:                There has been interval increase in size 
and number of the FDG avid lymph nodes. For example:
- Right hilar lymphadenopathy with SUV max of 6.8
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No abnormal uptake. Liver background 
SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 2.3.
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                No abnormal uptake
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Excreted activity is seen.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  No abnormal uptake
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             Diffuse increased FDG uptake in the 
stomach this is probably due to gastritis.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          Interval increase in size and FDG avidity of 
the right iliac bone metastasis the SUV is 9.6, previously 7.5. Other 
enlarged new bone lesions:
- Vertebral body of T8 which demonstrates mild compression fracture; this 
has enlarged compared to prior and demonstrates more intense FDG uptake.
- Right transverse process of T12 without CT correlate; this is a new 
lesion.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    None

**DATE[MM DD 2014]; MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Bilateral adrenal metastases on CT. Assess for other 
disease. Lung cancer.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Note is made of age related involutional changes of the brain 
parenchyma. Moderate scattered foci of white matter hyperintensity on the 
long TR images are nonspecific but probably related to chronic 
microvascular ischemia in thisage group. There is no evidence of acute 
infarction, enhancing parenchymal mass lesions or hydrocephalus.
 
OTHER: There are subcentimeter sclerotic lesions within right frontal and 
parietal bones and right occipital condyle without associated enhancement 
which probably represents bone islands. There are no expansile or 
destructive bony lesions. Well aerated paranasal sinuses.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of brain metastasis.

CLINICAL STATEMENT:  Lung, primary CA. Ordering MD: **NAME[YYY ZZZ CCC]: 
**NAME[M]/S  WHY? EOD  REASON: Reason For Study:Follow-up;   Patient is referred 
for restaging.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.2 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 66 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery STE-BR PET/CT 
with thepatient in the fasted state. Oral     contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 83 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalizedto patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                                  Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool, myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     Status post left upper lobe 
wedge resection with consolidation and traction bronchiectasis in the 
upper left lung consistent with post radiation change. There is 
heterogeneous FDG activity in this region,, SUV 3.2, previously 2.6. There 
is increased  focal FDG activity within this region, SUV 5.6, without CT 
correlate. Subpleural interstitial changes and nodularity at the left base 
is unchanged and not FDG avid. Patchy non-FDG avid right upper lobe and 
right lower lobe groundglass opacities are unchanged and not FDG avid.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       No abnormal uptake.
 
THORACIC NODES:                No abnormal uptake.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No abnormal uptake. Liver background 
SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is SUV.
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake.
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                No abnormal uptake. Resolved previously 
noted hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal activity.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:   Excreted activity is seen.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  Interval resolution previously noted hypermetabolic 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             No abnormal uptake.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:              No abnormal uptake.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          Unchanged non-FDG avid compression fracture 
deformities of the midthoracic spine.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    Unchanged bilateral hemiarthroplasty 
causing streak artifact, degrading image quality of the pelvis. Right 
chest wall port catheter tip terminates in the superior vena cava.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], interval resolution previously noted 
hypermetabolic bilateral adrenal metastases and resolution hypermetabolic 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Post radiation changes left lung, status post left upper lobe wedge 
resection with consolidation and traction bronchiectasis. Within this 
region, there is increased focal area of increased FDG activity probably 
representing post radiation change, with no CT correlate.
 
**DATE[MM DD 2016] Integrated Imaging Summary for recent CT and PET/CT scans
 
RECENT STUDY: CT chest and abdomen performed **DATE[MM DD 2016]
 
SUMMARY:
Concordant findings. Postradiation change in the left lung. Increased 
focal FDG activity within this region is probably post radiation in 
origin, given no underlying morphologic change on contrast-enhanced CT. 
Attention on follow-up.

OTHER STUDIES USED FOR CORRELATION: None
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool, myocardium.
 
LUNGS:       No abnormal uptake. 
Nonhypermetabolic left apical fibrosis, consolidation, and interstitial 
change is unchanged. Unchanged left apical scarring post left upper lobe 
wedge resection. New nonhypermetabolic right middle lobe 1 cm subpleural
nodule and adjacent groundglass infiltrate. Increased bibasilar 
interstitial lung markings likely related to low lung volumes and 
atelectasis or infectious/inflammatory etiology.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:         No abnormal uptake.
 
THORACIC NODES:                No abnormal uptake.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No abnormal uptake. Liver background 
SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 1.9
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake.

BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             Focal hypermetabolism at the 
anorectal junction is slightly increased probably inflammatory or 
physiologic, SUV 5.7 compared to 4.6. Diverticulosis coli. No bowel 
obstruction or ascites.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          No abnormal uptake. Post total hip 
arthroplasty changes bilaterally which create artifact limiting evaluation 
of the region..
 
OTHER FINDINGS:            Right chest wall port catheter tip 
terminates in the SVC. Coronary and aortic atherosclerotic calcification.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2016] and **DATE[MM DD 2016],
1. New nonhypermetabolic right middle lobe subsegmental interstitial 
infiltrate and pulmonary nodule likely infectious/inflammatory etiology. 
Follow-up is recommended.
2. Increased bibasilar interstitial markings likely atelectasis or 
infectious/inflammatory etiology.
3. Stable nonhypermetabolic post therapy changes in the left upper lung.
4. No new suspicious hypermetabolic lesion.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer     Patient is referred for 
follow-up.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.4 mCi F-18 FDG
 
TECHNIQUE:  Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 60 minute uptake period,  CT and PET images from the mid 
skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 710-BAIC PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state.   Oral  contrast material was 
administered for the CT scan. Please see separate CT dictation from the 
same date for integrated summary of PET/CT and CT findings.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 97 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

abdomen and pelvis **DATE[MM DD 2015]
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                         Hypermetabolic activity in 
Waldeyer's ring is probably within physiologic limits.   Physiologic FDG 
uptake is seen in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool, myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     A hypermetabolic left apical 
mass is stable in size since the prior PET, 1.8 x 1.6 cm and 
hypermetabolic with SUV of 5.8 from 4.2. Left lower lobe linear 
atelectasis. In the left posterior costophrenic recesses 2.1 x 1.4 cm 
nodule from 1.6 x 1.0 cm, previously masked on the prior PET by the 
effusion. This nodule is however not metabolically active.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       Resolution of left pleural effusion. Persistent 
near circumferential left pleural thickening with areas of focally 
increased hypermetabolic activity, for example posterior to the descending 
aorta with SUV of 5.3 from 2.44 posterior in the left costophrenic recess 
with an overall SUV of 4.9, previously not significantly avid.
 
THORACIC NODES:                Calcified subparotid lymph nodes are again 
identified. Lack of IV contrast limits the evaluation. However, there is 
focal activity at the hilum, which is new, SUV of 5.3. Previously seen 
supradiaphragmatic lymph nodes on the right side are not significantly 
avid.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No abnormal uptake.  Liver background 
SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 2.6

SPLEEN:                            Subtle subcentimeter low-attenuation 
focus in segment 8/5, too small to characterize. No new suspicious hepatic 
lesions.
 
PANCREAS:                      No substantial change in poorly defined 
low-attenuation lesion in the proximal pancreatic body associated with 
mild pancreatic ductal dilatation; this was FDG avid and suspicious for 
metastasis and the comparison is limited due to motion in both examination.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:        Stable mild bilateral adrenal thickening.
 
KIDNEYS:                            No hydronephrosis.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              Stable mildly prominent 
retroperitoneal nodes which were not FDG avid
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Stable mildly enlarged prostate gland.
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL: New substantial distention of gastricdistention, 
possibly transient due to recent ingestion of oral contrast. Colonic 
diverticula. No ascites. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Increased size of some of sclerotic lesions suspicious 
for metastases; for example the lesion at T12 vertebral body anterior to 
the right pedicle measuring 0.7 cm, previously punctate, and the lesion in 
left anterior femora head measures 1.3 cm, previously 1.1 cm and they were 
not evident on PET scan **DATE[MM DD 2014].  Stableleft fat-containing 
inguinal hernia.
 
OTHER:                               None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], no substantial change in left hilar tumor 
associated with stable left upper lobe consolidation. Persistent 
interlobular septal thickening in the left upper lobe, possibly 
lymphangitic carcinomatosis or lymphatic congestion or pulmonary edema.
2.  No substantial change in thoracic adenopathy with exception of 
decreased right paratracheal node, consistent with nodal disease.
3.  No substantial change in low-attenuation lesion in the proximal 
pancreatic body with ductal dilatation, suspicious for metastasis.
4.  Increased size of some of sclerotic osseous lesions, suspicious for 
metastases; they can represent either healing metastases or osteoblastic 
metastases. They cannot be distinguished on CT alone.
5.  New substantial gastric distention, possibly transient due to recent 
ingestion of oral contrast. Correlation with patient's symptoms suggested.

**DATE[MM DD 2014] MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer, evaluate extent of disease.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without intravenous contrast, protocol #1A. Sagittal 
and axial T1-weighted images; coronal and axial FLAIR images; axial 
susceptibility-weighted, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; and 
axial ADC and exponential ADC maps were obtained. Per the technologist 
note, the patient has a contrast allergy and was unwilling to receive 
premedication.
 
COMPARISON:MRI brain **DATE[MM DD 2014], CT brain **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], evolving postoperative changes are noted status post 
right suboccipital craniotomy. Small subjacent residual extra-axial 
collection is noted. There has been contraction of the resection cavity in 
the right lateral cerebellar hemisphere. Decreased surrounding edema and 
mass effect is noted. There is mild residual T2 signal hyperintensity 
surrounding the resection cavity, reflecting residual edema and/or gliosis.
 
Evaluation for residual/recurrent metastatic disease about the surgical 
cavity, also including previously seen lesions in the right cerebellar 
tonsil and left superior cerebellum is significantly limited without 
intravenous contrast administration. There is no new edema or new mass 
effect seen in the brain.
 
The ventricles and sulcal spaces are within normal limits. No evidence of 
hydrocephalus. No acute infarction or acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
Stable minimal fociof T2 signal hyperintensity in the cerebral white 
matter, likely chronic microvascular ischemic changes. Major intracranial 
flow voids are preserved.
 
OTHER:
 
Stable mucous retention cysts or polyps are seen in the bilateral 
maxillary sinuses. Mild mucosal thickening is also noted of the left 
sphenoid sinus. There is patchy fluid in the bilateral mastoid air cells. 
There is no suspicious osseous lesion.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Since CT brain **DATE[MM DD 2014], expected evolving postoperative changes with 
interval contraction of the right cerebellar resection cavity and 
decreased surrounding edema and mass effect.
2. Several metastatic lesions were seen on prior MRI brain **DATE[MM DD 2014]. 
Evaluation for residual/recurrent brain metastases is significantly 
limited without intravenous contrast administration. No new edema or mass 
effect.
3. Per the technologist note, the patient has a contrast allergy and was 
unwilling to receive premedication for the current study. If clinically 
indicated, consider further evaluation with postcontrast images when the 
patient is able to receive premedication.

CLINICAL STATEMENT:  nsclc.  EOD
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE(DLP): 200 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                 A left upper lobe mass extending to 
the left hilum encasing the left upper lobe bronchi measures 6.1 x 5.4 cm, 
previously 6.4 x 5.4 cm associated atelectasis distal to the mass is again 
noted. Increased septal markings at the left apical area are unchanged. 
Continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is present. Multiple 
calcified granulomas are present bilaterally without change.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:  Previous trace left pleural effusion is slightly 
larger.
 
THORACIC NODES:           A precarinal lymph node measures 4.6 x 3.2 cm, 
previously 4.3 x 3.2 cm, a subcarinal node measures 2.9 x 1.4 cm, 
previously 2.9 x 1.6 cm, a right paratracheal lymph node measures 1.4 x 
1.3 cm, previously 1.6 x 1.4 cm. Some additional adenopathy is present at 
the left paratracheal and subaortic area is without change. A left 
paratracheal lymph node on series 2 image 11 has slightly increased and 
measures 1.1 x 0.7 cm, previously 0.6 x 0.5 cm.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:          Unchanged mild enlargement of the left adrenal. A 
small right adrenal nodule measures 1.3 x 0.5 cm, previously 1.4 x 0.5 cm.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:A sclerotic focus at the right side of the T12 
vertebral body has enlarged. A sclerotic focus at the lateral right fifth 
rib is unchanged. A hemangioma at L2 is unchanged.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014], unchanged left upper lobe mass involving the left 
hilum consistent with lung neoplasm. Adjacent atelectasis is present. 
Previous increased septal markings at the left apex are unchanged and are 
suspicious for lymphangitic involvement. Elevation of the left diaphragm 
may relate to involvement of the phrenic nerve.
 
2.  Most of the previous mediastinal adenopathy is stable. A previous 
small left paratracheal lymph node has increased and is now borderline 
sized.
 
3.  Sclerotic foci are noted at the T12 vertebra and lateral right fifth 
rib consistent with metastases. T12 focus has become larger, possibly due 
to either interval increase of metastasis or reactive changes.
 
4.  Mild left adrenal enlargement and small right adrenal nodule are 
unchanged andpossibly represent metastases versus nonmetastatic process.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
There is no acute infarct, mass effect, acute hemorrhage, or suspicious 
intracranial enhancement. Prominence of the lateral ventricles is probably 
related to central volume loss. The temporal horns are not particularly 
dilated to suggest hydrocephalus. Multiple nonspecific subcentimeter T2 
hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter are probably secondary to 
mild/moderate chronic microvascular ischemic disease.

RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 813.98 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: Correlation is made to the brain MRI performed on **DATE[MM DD

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
There is no evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, acute hemorrhage, or 
suspicious intracranial enhancement. Prominence of the lateral ventricles 
is probably related to central volume loss. The temporal horns are not 
particularly
dilated to suggest hydrocephalus. Multiple nonspecific hypodensities in 
the cerebral white matter are probably secondary to mild/moderate chronic 
microvascular ischemic disease.
 
OTHER:
There are no expansile lytic or blastic osseous lesions in the calvarium 
and skull base.
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM DD 2014];
No evidence of acute intracranial pathology or metastatic disease.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 13.2 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 61 minute uptake period,low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 710 RS PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designedfor 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 82 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.
 
COMPARISON FDG PET/CT: **DATE[MM DD 2014]
 
OTHER STUDIES USED FOR CORRELATION: CT **DATE[MM DD 2016] and **DATE[MM DD 2014]
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, extraocular muscles, large salivary 
glands and oropharynx. Sinus opacities, considered inflammatory.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool and myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     No abnormal uptake. 
Subcentimeter right middle lobe nodule is not appreciably FDG avid. This 
nodule is unchanged in size since **DATE[MM DD 2014], and thus is considered 
benign.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       No abnormal uptake.
 
THORACIC NODES:
FDG avid enlarged left axillary nodal metastases.
1. Superior axillary node, SUV 10.5, image 64.
2. Inferior left axillary node, SUV 11.3, image 70.
3.Additional smaller mildly FDG avid nodes in the axilla and left breast 
axillary tail, image 89.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No abnormal uptake. Liver background 
SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 2.9, prior 2.2.
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake.
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                No abnormal uptake.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Excreted activity is seen.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  No abnormal uptake.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             No abnormal uptake.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:         Unchanged mildly linear FDG avidity (SUV 4.0) 
in left chest wall soft tissue, asymmetrically enlarged compared to the 
right side.  FDG avidity in right hip musculature, without corresponding 
CT abnormality, probably physiologic or inflammatory.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    Right chest wall port with the catheter 
tip in the right atrium.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. FDG avid left axillary and left breast axillary tail nodes. Fine-needle 
aspirate from **DATE[MM DD 2014] demonstrated metastasis in a leftaxillary 
node. The current FDG avid nodes are thus consistent with active 
malignancy.
2. Unchanged linear FDG avidity in the left chest wall. Fine-needle 
aspirate from **DATE[MM DD 2014] demonstrated histiocytes but was negative for 
malignancy. Given FNA results and stable appearance, this is considered 
inflammatory.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Metastatic adenocarcinoma, probably lung origin. 
History of breast cancer.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.2 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE:
This study is performed in conjunction with CTscan accession number 
**ID-NUM.
 
Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an approximately 72 minute 
uptake period, CT and PET images from the mid skull to the upper thighs 
were acquired on the Discovery 690-B PET/CT with the patient in the fasted 
state. Oral and intravenous contrast material was administered.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 96 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: There is been no significant overall change.
Ventricles and sulci lateral ventricles remain dilated out of proportion 
to the sulci, cisterns, third and fourth ventricle. This is likely an ex 
vacuo phenomenon.
Brain parenchyma diffuse, unchanged grade 3 leukomalacia.
Diffusion sequence shows no regional restriction.
Gradient and/or susceptibility sequence shows few scattered foci of 
susceptibility.
Extra-axial space demonstratesno subdural collection.
Brainstem and cerebellum remain unremarkable allowing for slight atrophy.
 
POST-CONTRAST images demonstrate No mass, enhancing lesion or evidence of 
leptomeningeal disease has developed.
There is no indirect MRI evidence for abnormal intracranial pressure.
 
OTHER: Mastoids demonstrate trace fluid signal.
Sinuses demonstrate no active disease.

FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                Post right middle lobectomy. 
Findings consistent with post radiation change in the paramediastinal 
right lung. The inferior portion of the fibrotic change (adjacent to the 
pleural effusion) has become slightly more dense and lobulated (series 3, 
image 29/30) since **DATE[MM DD 2014]. A few tiny left upper lobe nodules 
are new, measuring up to 0.4 cm, nonspecific.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Slightly increased small right pleural effusion. New 
fluid contiguous with the pleural effusion tracks through the fifth/sixth 
right interspace into the right chest wall. Stable 1.6 x 1.0 cm nodular 
focus posteriorly in the superior right pleural space, corresponding to 
focal FDG uptake on recent PET/CT.

Patient is referred for subsequent treatment strategy.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 13.2 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 91 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
near vertex to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-A 
PET/CT with the patient in the fasted state. Oral without intravenous 
contrast material was administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT 
study is designed for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of 
PET abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to produce, and 
cannot replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging 
protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 94 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic activity is noted within 
the brain and orbital regions.
CT brain window imagesdemonstrate no structural abnormality.
Orbits, fissures and lacrimal spaces appear unremarkable.
Mastoids and sinuses demonstrate no active disease. Incidental retention 
cyst right antrum.
Skull base and visualized calvarium appear intact. Sclerosis of the right 
lower mastoid is a typical postinflammatory process.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG activity is 
noted within the pharyngeal mucosa and major salivary glands.
CT images demonstrate no exophytic mucosal mass.
The glottic airway appears unremarkable.
Thyroid gland demonstrates no metabolic or structural lesion.
Metabolically active lymph nodes have developed with max SUV as follows:
6.0 at a right prescalene node measuring approximately 7 mmon CT image 69.
4.0 at smaller right lower scalene nodes which might be palpated as 
supraclavicular as shown on representative CT image 74-75.
4.2 at the the Virchow node station corresponds with CT image 74.
3.8 at the right level 6 node CT image 76.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool and left myocardium.
The MIP series demonstrates extensive progression of right pleural disease 
and a new discrete left posterior pleural deposits.
 
LUNGS:
Left hilar metabolic activity has increased as follows:
For example:
*  Left upper hilum, max SUV 8.2 measuring approximately 1.3 cm.
*  Left mid hilum, next SUV 7.6 increased compared with previous 4.1 
measuring approximately 1.7 cm
Crowding of the left lung markings may be related to the compressive 
atelectasis from pleural effusion.
There is increased metabolic activity related to the proximal 
bronchovascular structures at the left lower lobe with representative max 
SUVs as follows:
5.0 at the lateral basal segment.
4.3 at the posterior basal segment.
 
Right side demonstrates volume loss status post thoracotomy.
Metabolic activity at the right perihilar region may represent 
posttreatment inflammation. Representative max SUVs include 7.2 at the 
upper hilum and 6.4 at the lower hilum.
Consolidation at the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe produces 
elevated metabolic activity max SUV 10.0. This should be followed to 
clearance.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       Left hemithorax demonstrates new pleural 
effusion with metabolic activity equal to blood pool in the setting of 
which malignant effusion cannot be excluded. There is a well-defined 
pleural plaque at the dependent portion of the left lower lobe with max 
SUV 10.1 which is best appreciated in sagittal plane where the estimated 
metabolic dimension is at least 6 cm in length. Medial pleural-based 
metabolic focus below the left hilum shows max SUV 4.7, possibly 
posttreatment.
5.5 at the deep posterior costophrenic recess corresponds with CT image 
139..
Right side demonstrates an extensive rind of metabolic activity than. 
Although some of this may represent a treatment phenomenon there are 
scattered foci suspicious for active disease including:
6.7 posterior pleura corresponding with CT image 86.
5.7-5.8 right lateral pleura corresponds with CT image 100 as annotated.
6.9 posterior-lateral basal segment pleura corresponding with CT image 126.
 
THORACIC NODES:                Multiple foci of metabolic activity has 
developed with the following max SUV and characteristics:
9.8 right upper paratracheal might be exaggerated by attenuation 
correction artifact.
6.5 precarinal nodal station appears more extensive than preoperative 
examination.
4.5 related to a low retrocrural node at approximately the T12 level.
Metabolic activity related to the esophagus projects into the subcarinal 
station. This is likely related to esophagitis.
4.8 at the right pericardiophrenic lymph node corresponds with CT image 
128.
5.6 corresponds with a diaphragmatic lymph node on CT image 135.
Aggregate of metabolically active right axillary nodes have developed with 
representative max SUV 7.6 corresponding with CT image 82.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     Heterogeneous metabolic activity 
without suspicious focal complement or significant change. Liver 
background SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 2.6 
compared with previous 2.2.
 
SPLEEN:                                    No metabolic or structural 
abnormality.
Spleen is enlarged in length measuring 11.2 cm in oblique sagittal 
dimension.
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                No abnormal uptake.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Native physiologic activity 
without hydronephrosis.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  Increased metabolic activity at several 
abdominal-retroperitoneal lymph nodes with max SUV as follows:
9.9 just caudal to the portacaval node station corresponds with CT image 
144.
8.2 and 3.3 para-aortic Lymph nodes corresponding with CT image 156.
8.2 corresponds with a pericaval node corresponding with CT image 160.
13.8 corresponds with a perinephric node measuring approximately 1.1 cm on 
CT image 164.
12.5 interaortocaval lymph node station corresponds with CT image 169.
Other smaller metabolically active retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             Segmental bowel activity is 
physiologic. No mesenteric adenopathy or ascites has developed.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     Prostate gland is normal in size and 
demonstrates nonfocal, low-grade metabolic activity.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          The mid to lower cervical vertebra 
demonstrates intense metabolic activity suggesting progressive osseous 
metastases. The reformatted view demonstrates no compression fracture.
CT bone windows demonstrate unremarkable appearance of C1 and C2.
There are patchy sclerotic changes of C3-C7 most extensive at C5 and C7..
Other manifold osseous lesions are present with max SUV and 
characteristics as follows:
9.3 at the T1 vertebral body.
11.2 at a sclerotic left medial iliac bone lesion.
Scattered rib lesions including 5.3 at the left anterolateral sixth rib 
and 4.1 at the left lateral eighth rib.
Metabolic activity projecting at the intercostal space of the right 
lateral 56 level shows max SUV 6.6.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    Scrotal activity appears physiologic.
 
IMPRESSION: Some of the elevated metabolic changes might be secondary to 
change in the liver reference (2.6 compared with previous 2.2)
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014] diffuse systemic progression as detailed above.
2.  Metabolic activity within the right hemithorax might in part related 
to post treatment reaction.
3.  Dominant pleural plaque left lower lobe.
4.  Extensive metabolic disorder C3-T1 for which further imaging may be 
productive,

lobe bronchus the mass increased from 3.7 x 2.1 cm to 6.1 x 2.8 cm. An 
additional mass in the anterior right lung inseparable from mediastinum 
increased from 1.6 x 1.1 cm to 1.9x 1.6 cm. Increased groundglass 
opacities in the left lung; however micronodular pattern improved, 
particularly in the right lung.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Increased right pleural effusion associated with 
nodular pleural thickening which is probably metastatic. No left pleural 
effusion
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Small mediastinal lymph nodes are 
unchanged. The hila cannot be evaluated due to lack of intravenous 
contrast.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              Evaluation is limited due to lack of

increased possibly represents metastasis. There is new collapse of T6 
vertebral body which represents pathologic fracture. Additional metastatic 
lesions are possible.
 
OTHER:                               None
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015], increased dominant mass in the right lung, 
pleural metastases and malignant pleural effusion.
2.   Improved micronodular pattern particularly in the right lung, but 
groundglass opacities in the left lung increased. Findings may represent 
inflammatory process or drug toxicity.
3.  New collapse of T6 vertebral body with some narrowing of the spinal 
canal. Evaluation with MRI is recommended.
4.  Probable metastatic lesion in the left iliac bonewhich appears larger 
than previously, dedicated bone imaging is advised to evaluate for 
possible additional metastases.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Patient status post stereotactic radiosurgery **DATE[MM DD 2015] for 
left frontal lobe, left cerebellar vermis, left lateral cerebellar 
hemisphere and left cerebellar tonsillar lesions.
 
Stable subcentimeter enhancing lesion is noted within the cerebellar 
vermis posterior to the fourth ventricle image 11 series 18 as well as 
left cerebellar hemisphere/tonsil lesion image 7 series 18 with interval 
improvement in punctate enhancing metastasis within the left lateral 
cerebellar hemisphere image 8 series 18 since **DATE[MM DD 2015] examination.

Dominant enhancing metastasis remains within the left posterior parietal 
lobe image 27 series 18 measuring 0.7 x 0.6 cm in size previously 
measuring 0.7 x 0.6 cm on image 25 series 22 and therefore is grossly 
stable. Surrounding edema has mildly improved.
 
No additional abnormally enhancing lesions identified within the remaining 
brain parenchyma, leptomeninges or dura to suggest new metastases.
 
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss with mild periventricular white 
matter changes are identified in keeping with patient's age.
 
No suspicious focal lesions identified within the orbital soft tissues or 
cavernous sinus.
 
OTHER: No suspicious focal lesions identified within the calvarium or 
skull base.

FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                Status post left lower lobe wedge 
resection with stable consolidation at the left base. Volume loss on the 
left is again noted. There is increased nodularity in the left lung which 
is suspicious for metastatic disease. For example, a nodule in the left 
upper lobe measures 0.9 x 0.8 cm, new from the prior exam. Masslike 
opacity at the left apex measures 1.5 x 0.7 cm, new from the prior exam. A 
0.4 cm nodule in the right middle lobe is more prominent than on the prior 
exam perhaps due to differences in slice selection.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Patient status post prior stereotactic radiosurgery **DATE[MM DD 
2015] for left frontal lobe, left cerebellar vermis, left lateral 
cerebellar hemisphere and left cerebellar tonsillar lesions.  Unchanged 
appearance of the subcentimeter enhancing lesion is noted within the 
cerebellar vermis posterior to the fourth ventricle as seen on series 12 
image 10 as well as the tiny left cerebellar hemisphere/tonsil lesion and 
punctate enhancing metastasis within the left lateral cerebellar 
hemisphere series 12 image 7. . A few punctate newly appreciated lesions 
seen within the cerebellum on series 12 image 7 probably representing 
evolving sequelae of treatment however attention on follow-up is advised.
 
There has been interval increase in size of a now 0.4 cm, previously 
punctate enhancing lesion within the inferior aspect of the lefttemporal 
lobe situated along the superior surface of the left tentorial leaf on 
series 12 image 10, series 11 image 11 since **DATE[MM DD 2015], **DATE[MM DD 
2015] but not evident on **DATE[MM DD 2014] Forfile brain MRI.
 
The previously dominant enhancing metastasis remains within the left 
posterior parietal lobe has now contracted in size, currently measuring 
0.4 x 0.47 m, previously 0.7 x 0.6 cm . Surrounding edema is no longer 
apparent. Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss with mild periventricular 
white matter changes are identified, age-appropriate. No acute infarct. 
Normal intrarenal arterial flow-voids.
 
OTHER: No suspicious focal lesions identified within the calvarium or 
skull base.  No suspicious focal lesions identified within the orbital 
soft tissues or cavernous sinus.
 
IMPRESSION:  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015]:
1. Contracted dominant 0.7 cm enhancing metastasis of the left posterior 
parietal lobe with no significant residual surrounding edema or mass 
effect.
2.Although there is no substantial change in the again noted 
subcentimeter enhancing lesion within the vermis and left cerebellar 
hemisphere/tonsil with mild interval improvement in punctate enhancing 
metastasis within the left lateral cerebellarhemisphere, a few new 
punctate foci of enhancement are now identified within both hemispheres of 
the cerebellum, possibly representing evolving sequelae of therapy for 
attention on follow-up is advised..
3. Interval increase in the previously noted enhancing lesion situated on 
top of the superior surface of the left tentorial leaf, possibly 
extra-axial in location relative to the inferior aspect of the left 
temporal lobe, this lesion is new when compared to **DATE[MM DD 2014]. 
Differential diagnosis includes developing meningioma versus superficial 
possibly dural based increasing metastatic lesion.

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE: Evaluation is made of the portion of the head that is within 
the field-of-view.
No soft tissue findings of concern.
 
NECK:
No soft tissue findings of concern.
 
CHEST: Also see LUNGS, PLEURA/PERICARDIUM, and THORACIC NODES.
Thoracic esophagus again demonstrates minimal diffuse prominence of 
activity-possibly physiological variant uptake, rather than mild 
nonspecific inflammation.  At level of carina, a preeminent punctate focus 
of activity is visualized  - SUV Max 2.5 previously 2.2-previously 
somewhat indistinct; image 84, series 4. A discrete hypermetabolic 
esophageal lesion cannot be excluded. Endoscopic correlation suggested, if 
clinically appropriate.
 
LUNGS: Note that the low-dose companion CT of this study is optimized for 
attenuation correction and is not optimized for diagnostic evaluation of 
the lungs.
 
Irregularly-shaped previously identified residual right upper lobe lung
mass; stable on companion CT compared to **DATE[MM DD 2015]-again associated with 
minimal activity-equivalent to blood pool activity; SUV Max 1.5 previously 
1.2-stable, scintigraphically.
 
Small groundglass left upper lobe perihilar infiltrate-image88, series 3; 
FDG PET-negative      ; stable on companion CT ; probably stable on 
companion CT compared to dedicated CT study **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:
No findings of concern.
 
THORACIC NODES:
Left level 5/6 mediastinal lymph node-image 80, series 3:1.1 x 0.6 cm 
previously 0.9 x 0.3 cm; demonstrates faint hypermetabolic activity-SUV 
Max 2.4; new or previously indistinct, scintigraphically
Adjacent left pulmonary hilar lymph node, along the anterior aspect of 
left main pulmonary artery-image 83, series 3; stable in size-1.0 x 0.6 
cm; with mild hypermetabolic activity-SUV Max 2.9-previously 2.0

SPLEEN:
No findings of concern.
 
PANCREAS:
No findings of concern.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:
No findings of concern.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:
Scintigraphically-intense activity from excreted-tracer accumulations 
limits scintigraphic evaluation of renal parenchyma and the urinary tracts.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:
A collection of adjacent small mildly hypermetabolic retroperitoneal lymph 
nodes is again visualized, scintigraphically; lack of IV contrast and 
low-dose protocol limit companion CT structural evaluation. Possibly 
slightly increased; for example, left para-aortic lymph node that measures 
1.7 x 1.4 cm previously 1.2 x 1.1 cm, on limited companion CT; SUV Max 2.7 
previously 2.3.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:
No findings of concern.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:
No findings of concern in other pelvicviscera.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:
Evaluation is made of the portion of the skeleton that is within the 
field-of-view.
Multiple scattered radiodense bone lesions of metastatic etiology, stable 
on companion CT; none distinctly hypermetabolic- previously noted minimal 
activity in the radiodense lesion of the left coracoid process is 
stable-SUV Max 1.9 previously 1.7.
 
Sagittal spine reconstruction inspected . Moderate compression deformity, 
C7 vertebra; stable on companion CT
Schmorl nodule, L3 vertebra superior endplate; stable on companion CT
Right hip orthopedic hardware noted
 
EXTREMITIES:  Also see BONES/JOINTS and ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES
Evaluation is made of the portions of the extremities that are within the 
field-of-view.
No soft tissue findings of concern.
 
 
OTHER FINDINGS:
No other findings of note.
 
IMPRESSION:
Since PET/CT **DATE[MM DD 2015],
1.  No suspicious hypermetabolic bone lesions. Previously visualized 
radiodense bone lesions of metastatic etiology again demonstrate minimal 
to nil activity; probably treated disease. Stable on companion CT.
2.  Faintly hypermetabolic left hemi-mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph 
nodes, subcentimeter to  mildly enlarged; overall  slightly increased
prominence.  Possibly associated with # 3.
3.  Minimal diffuse thoracic esophageal activity again noted; stable.  A 
questionable punctate focus of preeminent esophageal activity noted at 
carinal level - possibly a small hypermetabolic esophageal lesion. 
Endoscopic correlation suggested if clinically appropriate.
4.  Residual right upper lobe lung mass with minimal activity; stable on 
PET/CT
5.  Groundglass small left pulmonary perihilar infiltrate;  FDG 
PET-negative  ; probably stable on limited companion CT at least as far 
back as the dedicated CT study of **DATE[MM DD 2014]

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDGuptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal blood pool, myocardium.
 
LUNGS: Redemonstrated irregular shaped mass in the right upper lobe with 
mild FDG avidity (remaining 1.7 x 1.1 cm, SUV 1.3; previously SUV 1.5), 
unchanged CT appearance since **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
Unchanged mild groundglass opacity in the left perihilar region, stable 
appearance since CT **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       No abnormal uptake.
 
THORACIC NODES: Subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are more prominent 
compared to prior study. For example,

*  A posterior prevascular lymph node (SUV 4.5, previously 2.9)
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No definite abnormal uptake. Probably 
overlap of activity from underlying bowel in liver inferiorly. Liver 
background SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 1.7, 
previously 1.9.
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake.

x 1.5 cm, SUV 3.1)
 
 BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY: Linear FDG avidity is seen in the esophagus, probably related 
to post radiation esophagitis. Unchanged uptake focal uptake in the 
esophagus at the carina level (SUV 2.5, image 88, previously 2.5), 
nonspecific.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake.

MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: headache  lung cancer.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2013].
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: The right sphenoid wing meningioma appears slightly more 
conspicuous which is probably due to differences in image acquisition. It 
continues to measure 1 cm in greatest diameter. There are no new enhancing 
parenchymal mass lesions, hydrocephalus or acute infarction. No evidence 
of extra-axial collections.
 
OTHER: The left anterior frontal metastasis has essentially resolved. 
Minimal residual heterogeneity at the same location probably represents 
treated disease. New marrow heterogeneity within the clivus is nonspecific 
but probably related to treatment effects.
 
 
IMPRESSION: Compared to **DATE[MM DD 2013];
1. Unchanged 1 cm right sphenoid wing meningioma.
2. No evidence of brain metastasis or an acute intracranial abnormality.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
 
Review of the patient's electronic medical record demonstrates the patient 
underwent whole brain radiation therapy and the end of **DATE[MM 2015].
 
The left frontal metastasis involving the left inferior frontal gyrus has 
decreased in size from 0.3 to 0.2 cm. The metastasis involving the left 
superior frontal gyrus has decreased in size from 0.4 cm to 0.2 cm. The 
punctate areas of enhancement in the left middle frontal gyrus and the 
right occipital lobe are unchanged in size. The hemorrhagic metastasis in 
the left temporal lobe has not appreciably changed in size. The previously 
seen nonenhancing areas of susceptibility in the right frontal lobe and 
the right parietal lobe are not appreciably changed.
 
No new areas of abnormal enhancement are identified to indicate new 
metastatic lesions. There is no evidence for development of leptomeningeal 
disease. No change in the scatter periventricular leukoencephalopathy. No 
hydrocephalus, acute infarction or acute hemorrhage.
 
A 0.7 cm meningioma over the right frontal lobe is unchanged dating back 
to **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
OTHER:
 
Scattered reactive changes persist in the paranasal sinuses. Orbits and 
nasopharynx are unremarkable. No change in the partial opacification of 
the left tympanomastoid air cells
 
There is probably no appreciable change in what is probably a partially 
visualized metastasis involving the left side of the C2 vertebral body.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: lung carcinoma evaluate extent of disease.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.3 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 64 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery STEBR PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral and contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.

**DATE[MM DD 2015] MRI total spine
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer primary. Increasing pain in the 
thoracolumbar spine.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI total spine without and with intravenous contrast, protocol 
#14.Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted 
images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted images were 
obtained.
 
COMPARISON: No prior imaging studies dedicated to the spine are available 
for comparison. The current study is compared to a PET CT scan dated **DATE[MM 
DD 2015].
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE:
 
Please note that there is lumbarization of the S1 vertebral body. This is 
important to acknowledge, especially if interventional procedures are 
planned.
 
Multiple areas of abnormal signal intensity are identified consistent with 
metastases. These include the T12, L3 vertebral bodies as well as S1 
segment, the left sacral ala and probably the right iliac bone (series 13, 
image 36).. Metastases also involve the left lamina, pedicle and 
transverse process of T11 and T12.
 
There is no definitive epidural disease.
 
Degenerative changes are identified at L5-S1 and S1-S2 including the 
inferior endplate infraction of the S1 vertebral body which is probably 
degenerative in nature. There is a mild degree of spinal stenosis at this 
level.
 
OTHER:
 
There is no evidence for leptomeningeal disease. There is no evidence for 
abnormal signal intensity or enhancement of thevisualized structures of 
the posterior fossa or the cord. Degenerative changes are identified in 
the cervical spine including an osteophytic ridge/disc at C3-C4.
 
There is also probable involvement of the head of the left T10 rib.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. No prior dedicated MRI examinations of the spine are available for 
comparison.
2. Multilevel, multifocal metastatic disease as described above. There is 
no pathological vertebral body collapse or epidural extension or 
leptomeningeal disease.

BONE:                                 Increased size of the lesion in the 
right distal clavicle, consistent with metastasis; the lesion measures 3.2 
x 2.4 cm, previously 1.3 x 1.0 cm, and it is more expansile with new 
extraosseous extension and cortical destruction at the coracoclavicular 
ligament insertion; the lesion was previously lytic and FDG avid on PET. 
New mild bone marrow edema pattern in the distal clavicle adjacent to 
metastasis.
 
No new suspicious osseous lesions in the imaged proximal humerus scapula 
and mid to distal clavicle.

TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 64-minute uptake period, CT and PET images from the level of 
the skullbase to the level of the proximal thigh regions   were acquired 
on the GE Discovery DSTE with the patient in the fasted state. Oral 
contrast material was administered.
 
The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for attenuation 
correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. This companion 
CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, state-of-the-art 
diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for different body 
parts and indications.
 
Blood glucose at the time of this test: 71 mg/dl.
 
When reported, the standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to 
patient body weight and indicate the highest activity concentration 
(SUVmax) in a given disease site.

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE: Evaluation is made of the portion of the head that is within 
the field-of-view.
No soft tissue findings of concern.
 
NECK:
Soft tissue calcifications again visualized in bilateral palatine 
tonsillar regions. Asymmetrical prominence of activity in fullness of soft 
tissues noted in the left palatine tonsillar region; stable PET CT 
appearance; lack of IV contrast limits companion CT structural evaluation. 
Possibly chronic/recurrent infectious/inflammatory etiology. Clinical 
correlation advised. SUV Max 8.9 previously 9.4-stable scintigraphically.     
Activity in the right palatine tonsillar region is lesser and nonspecific.
 
CHEST:  Also see LUNGS, PLEURA/PERICARDIUM, and THORACIC NODES.
No findings of note in other chest soft tissues.
 
LUNGS:
0.8 cm peripheral, subpleural right upper lobe nodule - too small to 
characterize, scintigraphically (ie, PET has lower sensitivity for 
subcentimeter disease)but stable on companion CT ; non-specific
Subcentimeter nodule along the major fissure of the right lung, 
anteriorly; stableon companion CT.
No suspicious hypermetabolic pulmonary foci
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:
Small pericardial effusion; grossly stable on limited companion CT.
No pleural effusions
 
THORACIC NODES:
No findings of concern.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:
No findings of concern.
 
 
SPLEEN:
No findings of concern.
 
PANCREAS:
No findings of concern.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:
No findings of concern.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:
Scintigraphically-intense activity from excreted-tracer accumulations 
limits scintigraphic evaluation of renal parenchyma and the urinary tracts.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:
No findings of concern.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:
No findings of concern.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:
No findings of concern in other pelvic viscera.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:
Evaluation is made of the portion of the skeleton that is within the 
field-of-view.
Scattered hypermetabolic bone foci, consistent with metastatic disease; 
variably osteolytic on companion CT or with no companion CT 
correlate-consistent with marrow based lesions at those CT occult sites. 
Overall increased-including newly visualized hypermetabolic lesions. 
Selected index foci as follows:
*  Hypermetabolic osteolytic lesion of the left pubis-image 250 of series 
3, series 4; new; SUV Max 6.7
*  Elongate expansile hypermetabolic osteolytic mass in the anterior 
cortex of the right femoral diaphysis, proximally-image 276 of series 3, 
series 4; again protrudes into the overlying thigh musculature and to a 
lesser extent into the femoral marrow cavity. More radiodense than 
previously visualized. Otherwise stable structurally, on companion CT-2.7 
cm greatest axial diameter. SUV Max 7.5 previously 7.7-stable 
hypermetabolic activity
*  New hypermetabolic focus in the left ischio acetabular structure-SUV 
Max 9.3;  no companion CT correlate , suggesting disease predominantly 
involves marrow
*  The hypermetabolic osteolytic manubrial metastasis previously 
visualized is more radiodense on companion CT and diminished 
scintigraphically; SUV Max 4.2 previously 8.3. Otherwise, previously 
visualized hypermetabolic osseous metastatic disease increased.
 
Sagittal spine reconstruction inspected
 
EXTREMITIES:  Also see BONES/JOINTS and ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES
Evaluation is made of the portions of the extremities that are within the 
field-of-view.
No soft tissue findings of concern.
 
 
OTHER FINDINGS:

IMPRESSION:
Since PET CT **DATE[MM DD 2015],
1.  Osseous metastatic disease; increased, including new bony lesions.
2.  Subcentimeter right lung nodules; stable on companion CT. Again FDG 
PET-negative.
3.  Small pericardial effusion-stable on CT.
4.  Possible chronic/recurrent infectious/inflammatory lesion of left 
palatine tonsil. Clinical/visual inspection advised.

COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2016].
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                No substantial change in right 
middle lobe nodule measuring 2.8 x 1.5 cm.Slight increase in adjacent 
post obstructive atelectasis. Unchanged 0.6 cm  and 0.5 cm right middle

**DATE[MM DD 2015] CT of chest
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer with left neck swelling. 
Assess superior vena cava for SVC syndrome.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet tothe lung bases with intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 402.74 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: Submitted PET CT scan **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                 Right perihilar mass like 
consolidation extending into the right lower lobe with parenchymal 
consolidation in the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and lower lobes 
with cicatrization bronchiectasis consistent with post radiation change 
and is unchanged since the PET CT of **DATE[MM DD 2015]and **DATE[MM DD 2015]. A 
2.5 x 2.3 cm mass in the apical posterior segment of the left upper lobe 
abutting the major fissure has a small area of central cavitation. 
Previously this measured 2.5 x 1.9 cm. A second mass in the apical 
posterior segment more superiorly and abutting the major fissure (series 3 
image 16) is 1.8 x 0.9 cm previously 1.5 x 1.1 cm. There are no additional 
lung nodules..
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:  Small right pleural effusion is partially loculated 
and unchangedfrom prior study. No pleural effusion on the left. There is 
a small pericardial effusion, unchanged from prior study.
 
MEDIASTINUM/
THORACIC NODES:           A high left superior mediastinal node at the 
level of the thoracic inlet is 1.0 x 1.0 cm and was FDG avid on the recent 
PET CT scan. Additional small left anterior mediastinal nodes measure up 
to 1.3 x 0.7 cm and are FDG avid as well. These also show little change 
from prior study. A more discrete node slightly more caudally inthe 
anterior mediastinum (series 2 image 16) on the left is 1.4 x 1.0 cm and 
is unchanged. Left hilar adenopathy is present with the largest node 2.1 x 
1.3 cm, probably unchanged from prior study as well though poorly measured 
on the prior scan as there was no intravenous contrast administered. 
Posterior mediastinal nodes in the lower chest measure up to 1.1 x 0.7 cm 
and are unchanged (series 2 image 41) and were not FDG avid on PET/CT. 
Small right retrocrural node with a fatty hilum is unchanged and was not 
FDG avid on PET/CT.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:          Unremarkable.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  Unremarkable.
 
OTHER:                                Tip of a left central line is in the 
superior vena cava. The superior vena cava is patent. However the left 
brachiocephalic vein is severely stenotic as there is only minimal 
contrast seen within the left brachiocephalic vein with the bulk of the 
venous inflow diverted through collateral vessels.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since PET CT of **DATE[MM DD 2015] post radiation changes in the right lung 
are unchanged. Slight enlargement of one of the 2 masses in the left upper 
lobe. Both were FDG avid on the submitted PET CT scan.
2.  Thoracic adenopathy with left superior and anterior mediastinal nodes 
and left hilar adenopathy, all of which was FDG avid on the submitted PET 
CT scan. Small lower thoracic posterior mediastinal nodes and a small 
right retrocrural node were not FDG avid.
3.  No adrenal mass.
4.  Indwelling left central line with the tip in the superior vena cava 
which is entirely patent. The left brachiocephalic vein is severely 
stenotic with minimal venous flow through the vein with the bulk of the 
injected contrast flowing into collateral vessels. This explains the 
patient's left neck swelling.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] CT of chest
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer. Status post definitive 
thoracic radiation.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 447.48 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: CT chest **DATE[MM DD 2015] and submitted PET CT scan **DATE[MM 
DD 2015].
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:       Extensive consolidation at the site 
of the original known mass within the right hilum involving the right 
upper, middle and lower lobes shows little change compared to prior scan. 
However there is some increased consolidation medially within the right 
lower lobe since prior study. Relatively straight lateral margins is 
consistent with post radiation change.
 
An elliptical mass like lesion in the apical posterior segment of the left 
upper lobe is 2.7 x 1.5 cm unchanged from prior study. However the 
superior aspect of this lesion now has a rounded nodular mass like 
component measuring 1.8 x 1.7 cm (series 3 image 17) which is a change 
from prior scan when there were 2 contiguous small nodules which measured 
0.6 x 0.6 cm each. A satellite nodule more posteriorly in the same segment 
measures 0.6 x 0.5 cm.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:  There is a small right pleural effusion which is 
partially loculated no pleural effusion on the left. Pericardial effusion 
is unchanged.
 
MEDIASTINUM/
THORACIC NODES:           Left hilum is enlarged and I suspect there is a 
2.2 x 1.7 cm node present, probably unchanged from prior study. A left 
supraclavicular node measures 1.3 x 1.0 cm previously 1.1 x 1.1 cm. Left 
posterior mediastinal nodes superior to the crus of the diaphragm measure 
up to 1.2 x 0.8 cm previously 1.3 x 0.8 cm. There are bilateral 
retrocrural nodes, the larger on the right measuring 1.1 x 0.8 cm 
previously 1.4 x 1.0 cm.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:          Unremarkable.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  There is an enlarging lytic metastasis within the 
left side of the manubrium. No additional osseous metastases identified.
 
OTHER:                                None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015] right perihilar mass with involvement of right 
upper and middle lobes and right lower lobes is unchanged except for 
slight increased consolidation medially within a portion of the right 
lower lobe. There is a post radiation elliptical opacity in the apical 
posterior segment of the left upper lobe. However a nodular component of 
the superior aspect of this has enlarged and is suspicious for viable 
tumor. Suggest correlation with PET CT scan.
2.  Left hilar adenopathy is unchanged and a left supraclavicular node is 
slightly smaller.
3.  Small loculated right pleural effusion and no pericardial effusion are 
unchanged.
4.  No adrenal mass.
5.  New lytic metastasis within the manubrium.
 
Telephone notification regarding the suspected viable mass in the left 
upper lobe of the lung and the new lytic metastasis in the manubrium was 
made to Dr. **PHYS_NAME **PHYS_NAME on **DATE[MM DD 2016] at 9:35 AM.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer. Brain metastases.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: Compared to the most recent prior MRI from MSK CC dated 
**DATE[MM DD 2014] and to an MRI from an outside institution dated **DATE[MM DD 
2015].
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
 
The previously seen, hemorrhagic, left temporal lobe metastasis has 
decreased in size from 2.0 x 0.8 cm to 1.7 x 0.8 cm. The previously seen 
right cerebellar metastasis measuring 0.3 cm is not appreciably changed. 
No new metastases are identified. No change in the moderate to severe 
degree of periventricular leukoencephalopathy which is probably treatment 
related. No change in what are probably small right cerebellar and left 
parietal infarctions. No hydrocephalus, acute infarction or acute 
hemorrhage.
 
OTHER:
 
The visualized portions of the orbit, nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses 
are unremarkable. There is partial opacification of the tympanomastoid air 
cells bilaterally. No new suspicious bony lesions are seen.
 
IMPRESSION: Since MRI examination from an outside institution dated **DATE[MM] 
22, 2015:
1. Continued interval contraction in size of several brain metastases, 
most no longer apparent.
2. No new metastatic disease.

FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Study is limited by extensive motion artifact. Previously seen 
chronic hemorrhagic lesion that is precontrast hyperintense on T1 
sequence, in the left anterior temporal lobe is stable. Scattered foci 
susceptibilityartifact are again noted and slightly more conspicuous on 
this scan, probably from technique. Focal encephalomalacia in the left 
posterior occipital lobe and left medial parietal lobe are stable. Stable 
focal patchy enhancement in the right cerebellum. No definite new or 
worsened suspiciously enhancing brain lesions or mass effect. A benign 
developmental venous anomaly in the left occipital lobe is stable. 
Confluent and patchy nonenhancing hyperintense T2/flair signal in the 
bilateral white matter is stable. The ventricles are stably prominent. No 
midline shift or downward herniation. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, 
infarct, or extra-axial collections.

inlet to the pubic symphysis after oral and intravenous contrast 
administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 819.00 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: Noncontrast CT scan of the chest **DATE[MM DD 2015], PET CT scan 
**DATE[MM DD 2015] and CT chest abdomen pelvis with CT urogram **DATE[MM DD 2014].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                There is complete left upper lobe 
consolidation with associated volume loss which is shown to be FDG avid on 
the PET CT scan of **DATE[MM DD 2015]. Surgical staple lines are seen within 
this portion of the lung. Only minimal residual aeration is seen high in 
the left apex. Surgical staple line with surrounding soft tissue within 
the anterior segment of the right upper lobe was previously shown to be 
FDG avid on the PET CT scan. A 0.9 cm subpleural nodule in the right lower 
lobe is unchanged as is a 0.4 cm nodule more caudally in the right lower 
lobe (series 3 images 31 and 53). Patchy subpleural ground glass opacity 
is seen in the lower right lung.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: No pleural effusion. Small pericardial effusion is 
seen primarily within the pericardial recesses.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Small left anterior mediastinal nodes 
measure up to 0.8 x 0.7 cm. A high left paratracheal node is 1.0 x 0.9 cm 
previously 0.5 x 0.5 cm.

KIDNEYS:                            No mass or hydronephrosis in either 
kidney. Parenchymal atrophy in the upper pole of the left kidney is 
unchanged.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              No adenopathy.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:  Status post radical cystoprostatectomy and 
creation of an ileal neobladder with no pelvic tumor recurrence.
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     Surgical bowel staples lines related to the bladder 
reconstruction.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Enlarging blastic lesion in the anterior column of the 
right acetabulum now measures 1.0 x 0.7 cm and was 0.7 x 0.6 cm on the PET 
CT scan of **DATE[MM DD 2013]. On the scan of **DATE[MM DD 2011] this was 0.3 x 
0.3 cm. Healing fracture of the posterior lateralleft sixth rib. 
Sclerotic lesion in the left humeral head is unchanged.
 
OTHER:                               None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015] unchanged extensive left upper lobe 
consolidation with volume loss. The convex bulgeposteriorly implies 
presence of mass which was shown to be FDG avid on the PET/CT scan of 
**DATE[MM DD 2015]. The right upper lobe wedge resection scar and additional 
small nodules right lower lobe are unchanged.
2.  Status post radical cystoprostatectomy with no recurrent mass.
3.  Indeterminate lesion at junction of hepatic segments 4A/B and 5/8.

**DATE[MM DD 2015] MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT:   Lung Cancer.  Evaluate extent of disease
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2010] **DATE[MM DD 2015] MRI brain
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: There is no acute major vascular territory infarction or acute 
intracranial hemorrhage. There is no abnormal enhancement within the brain 
parenchyma, leptomeninges or dura to suggest metastatic disease.   
Ventricles, sulci and cisterns are are prominent consistent with 
parenchymal volume loss. Periventricular and subcortical FLAIR 
hyperintense white matter changes are nonspecific and likely represent 
sequelae of chronic microangiopathic change, slightly increased compared 
to examinations dating back to **DATE[MM DD 2010]. Remote infarcts are again 
noted within the left centrum semiovale.
 
OTHER: There is a persistent but unchanged left mastoid effusion. 
Otherwise visualized paranasal sinuses and right mastoid air cells are 
well-aerated. The visualized portions of the posterior nasopharynx are 
unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:  Since **DATE[MM DD 2010]:
1. No abnormal enhancement within the brain parenchyma, leptomeninges or 
dura to suggest metastatic disease.
2. No acute intracranial pathology.

RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 903 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                Unchanged, complete left upper lobe collapse 
associated with mild volume loss demonstrated FDG-avidity on PET/CT scan 
dated **DATE[MM DD 2015] and corresponds to biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma 
(post CT-guided biopsy **DATE[MM DD 2015]; recent pathological results 
from CT-guided biopsy dated **DATE[MM DD 2015] are pending). Increased soft 
tissue attenuation adjacent to the right middle lobe wedge resection 
suture line which demonstrated FDG-avidity on **DATE[MM DD 2015] is 
consistent with tumor recurrence. A 1.0 x 0.9 cm lobular right lower lobe 
nodule previously measured 0.8 x 0.7 cm (remeasured) and is consistent 
with pathologically proven adenocarcinoma (post CT-guided biopsy dated 
**DATE[MM DD 2015]). Unchanged 0.4 cm right lower lobe nodule is consistent 
with agranuloma given greater than 2 year stability (unchanged at least 
since **DATE[MM DD 2013]). New bilateral upper lobe patchy airspace 
consolidation extending to the pleural surfaces is consistent with 
multifocal pneumonia/pneumonitis versus radiation change. Mild upper lung 
zone centrilobular emphysematous changes.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: New small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Unchanged, enhancing borderline-sized 
0.9 x 0.8 cm left anterior mediastinal/prevascular node and other smaller 
upper mediastinal nodes, probably representing nodal metastases. 
Unchanged, borderline-sized right hilar node.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              No new lesion. Unchanged subcapsular 1.3 x 0.8 
cm segments 4B/5 lesion remains indeterminate. No biliary ductal 
dilatation. Unremarkable gallbladder.

PANCREAS:                      Unremarkable.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:        Unchanged mild hyperplasia.
 
KIDNEYS:                            No hydronephrosis. Unchanged left 
renal cyst and bilateral low-attenuation lesions, too small to 
characterize, consistent with cysts. Unchanged left interpolar cortical 
scarring.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              No adenopathy.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Post radical cystoprostatectomy with an 
unremarkable post surgical bed. No evidence of upper tract disease.
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     Colonic diverticulosis. No intestinal obstruction or 
ascites. Unremarkable enteric suture line related to neobladder formation.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: 1.0 x 0.7 cm sclerotic lesion in the anterior column 
of the right acetabulum, measuring 0.3 x 0.3 cm on **DATE[MM DD 2011]and 0.7 x 
0.6 cm on **DATE[MM DD 2013], without FDG-avidity on recent PET/CT scan 
dated **DATE[MM DD 2015], possibly representing a bone island. A 1.3 x 0.8 cm 
sclerotic lesion in the left femoral head is unchanged since **DATE[MM DD 
2015], minimally increased in size in comparison to a remote examination 
dated **DATE[MM DD 2011] when it measured 1.0 x 0.6 cm, and not FDG-avid on 
PET/CT dated **DATE[MM DD 2015], therefore consistent with a bone island. 
Unchanged, minimally displaced posterolateral left sixth rib fracture with 
callus formation indicative of healing. Subcutaneous ventral abdominal 
stranding is consistent with injection sites.
 
OTHER:                               None.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015], mild increase in size of a right lower lobe 
nodule representing a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma and increased soft 
tissue attenuation along a right middle lobe wedge resection line 
consistent with tumor recurrence.
 
2.  Unchanged left upperlobe collapse and biopsy-proven underlying 
adenocarcinoma.
 
3.  New bilateral upper lobe multifocal pneumonia/pneumonitis versus 
radiation change.

Ill-defined patchy airspace opacification within the posterior left lung 
is decreased. A 0.4 cm nodule posterior left lung was previously obscured 
by atelectasis and is indeterminate.
 
2.0 cm soft tissue nodule along the right middle lobe suture line is 
unchanged since **DATE[MM DD 2015], noted to be FDG avid on PET/CT of

since the prior study however previously demonstrated stability over a 
two-year period. Follow-up imaging advised.
 
Patchy groundglass opacities within the bilateral upper lobes are mildly 
decreased, however mildly increased in the anterior right lower lobe, 
probably inflammatory versus post radiation change.

**DATE[MM DD 2015] MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer. Evaluate for metastases.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
 
Multiple sequences including postcontrast images are degraded by motion. 
Within this limitation, there are no enhancing lesions within the dura, 
leptomeninges or parenchyma. A small focus of susceptibility effect within 
the right parietal lobe (series 6 image 36) without evidence of 
corresponding enhancement or associated FLAIR hyperintensity is noted.
 
There is no acute major vascular territory infarction or acute 
intracranial hemorrhage. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are within normal 
limits. Periventricular and subcortical white matter FLAIR 
hyperintensities are nonspecific and likely represent sequelae of chronic 
microangiopathic change.
 
OTHER: There is opacification of the left. No definite calvarial osseous 
lesions.
 
IMPRESSION:
No comparisons available.
 
 
1. No definite enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma, 
leptomeninges or dura within limitations of motion degraded study. Small 
focus of susceptibility effect within the right parietal lobe without
corresponding enhancement or associated FLAIR hyperintensity probably 
represents a small focus of chronic microhemorrhage or vasculature 
adjacent to a sulcus, and much less likely metastasis; attention to this 
region on follow-up imaging is recommended.
 
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute major vascular territory 
infarction.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer. Status post right upper 
lobectomy and chemoradiation. Patient is referred for extent of disease 
evaluation.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.4 mCiF-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 66 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
base of the skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the BAIC  PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 81 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

lesions throughout the liver were present on prior CT, and were not FDG 
avid on prior PET. The esophagus is again noted to be diffusely thickened, 
and contains debris. Left thyroidectomy.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015], no pulmonary embolus.
2.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased since more recent 
prior PET/CT.
3.  Increased extensive left lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation, and 
increased regions of atelectasis throughout the lungs.
4.  Increased medial right lower lobe ground glass opacities, probably 
radiation pneumonitis.
5.  Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
6.  Persistent diffuse thickening of the esophagus, nonspecific.
 
These findings were discussed with Dr. Tray on **DATE[MM DD 2015] at 10:00

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer. Evaluate extent of disease.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the lung bases with intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 318 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                 Right upper lobectomy. Slightly 
increased peribronchial/peri-fissural nodularity with septal thickening in 
the left lower lobe is suspicious for lymphangitic carcinomatosis. 
Nodularity with similar imaging characteristics in the right lower lobe 
and right middle lobe is also slightly increased.
 
Slightly increased dense consolidationin the remainder of the left lower 
lobe is possibly neoplastic or atelectasis/pneumonia. Consolidative 
opacity posteriorly in the right lower lobe is probably unchanged in 
extent but slightly increased in density.
 
2 previously cavitating right lower lobe lesions are slightly reduced in 
size but with increased soft tissue component, for example the more 
superior lesion currently 1.7 x 0.9 cm, previously 2.0 x 1.0 cm.
 
Resolved consolidation in the lingula probably improved pneumonia.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:  Increased small bilateral pleural effusions, left 
greater than right. Unchanged small pericardial effusion.
 
MEDIASTINUM/
THORACIC NODES:           Unchanged dominant right superior diaphragmatic 
node measures 1.3 x 1.3 cm. Additional smaller scattered mediastinal nodes 
are unchanged.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:          Slightly increased bilateral adrenal masses, for 
example in the left currently 4.7 x 3.5 cm, previously 4.3 x 3.2 cm.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  Osseous metastases slightly increased in size in the 
L1, L2 and T3 vertebral bodies.
 
OTHER:                                A few small low-attenuation hepatic 
foci are too small to characterize, probably unchanged. Incidentally noted 
double aortic arch.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015], slightly increased suspected lymphangitic 
carcinomatosis.
2.  Slightly increased dense left lower lobe consolidation, possibly 
neoplastic and/or infectious/inflammatory.
3.  Slightly increased osseous metastases, adrenal metastases and small 
pleural effusions.
4.  Reduced size but increased density of cavitating right lung lesions, 
possibly neoplastic or infectious.
5.  Resolved suspected lingular pneumonia.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 13.1 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 99 minute uptake period, CT and PET images from the mid 
skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-B PET/CT with 
the patient in the fasted state. Oral and intravenous contrast material 
was administered.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 75 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

OTHER STUDIES USED FOR CORRELATION: CT chest **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                Minimally FDG avid nonspecific symmetric 
infiltration of the facial subcutaneous fat, unchanged, possibly related 
to cosmetic procedure.
 
PhysiologicFDG uptake is seen in the visualized regions of the brain, 
large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.

**DATE[MM DD 2015] MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer, whole brain radiation 
therapy 2011, evaluate extent of disease.
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: Brain MRIs dated **DATE[MM DD 2015] and **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: The left gyrus rectus lesion measuring 0.4 cm (series 11 image 14), 
is unchanged from **DATE[MM DD 2015]. The lesion involving the right 
anterior frontal lobe, along the right middle frontal gyrus, is decreased 
from **DATE[MM DD 2015], currently measuring 0.1 cm, previously 0.3 cm. A 
punctate enhancing focus in the left posterior parietal lobe (series 11 
image 20), measuring 0.2 cm is unchanged from **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
A punctate focus of enhancement along the more posterior right middle 
frontal gyrus (series 11 image 23), is new. There is an additional 
punctate enhancing focus in the left anterior temporal lobe (series 11 
image 13 and series 10 image 6). These lesions are nonspecific and 
possibly represent small metastases, prominent vessels, or possibly 
postischemic enhancement.
 
There are multiple new foci of increased diffusion-weighted signal, the
largest in the left cerebellum demonstrating restriction, suspicious for 
an acute to early subacute lacunar infarct. Additional punctate foci are 
noted in the right cerebellum, the left occipital lobe, the left parietal 
lobe, the right caudate head, the left frontal white matter and the left 
precentral gyrus. These foci are suspicious for small infarcts rather than 
nonenhancing metastases. The distribution of these foci suggests an 
embolic etiology.
 
Multiple foci of susceptibility effect probably relate to radiation 
therapy and microangiopathic changes. Diffuse supratentorial white matter 
signal abnormality is unchanged, probably treatment related changes. There 
is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus.
 
OTHER: The left parietal paramedian calvarial lesion is unchanged from the 
prior studies. Bone marrow signal is otherwise heterogeneous without 
evidence of new lesion. The orbits are unremarkable. There are mild 
inflammatory changesof the paranasal sinuses.

HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                    Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles. Calcification in the left thyroid is noted again, 
unchanged.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is seen 
in mediastinal bloodpool, myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     Multiple hypermetabolic pleural 
thickenings are again seen in the right posterior lung and pleura. There 
are interval new or recurrent hypermetabolic right hilar focal activity, 
for example, a posterior right hilar focus 1.3 cm (SUV 9.9). This is 
suspicious for lymph node spread or hilar recurrence.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       Hypermetabolic pleural thickening/mass and 
calcification in the right posterior pleura, as mentioned above. This 
could be due to prior pleurodesis.
 
THORACIC NODES:                As mentioned above, otherwise no abnormal 
uptake.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     Interval new multiple hypodense lesions 
all over the liver parenchyma, hypermetabolic, consistent with new 
metastatic disease. For example, a right lobe lesion 3.7 cm (SUV 20.6).
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake.

KIDNEYS/URETERS/BLADDER:                                 Excreted activity 
is seen.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  Hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy is seen in the 
retrocrural/paracaval nodes in the upper abdomen. This is consistent with 
nodal spread.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/MESENTERY:                             No abnormal uptake.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake.

spine noted.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    None.
 
IMPRESSION:
Since **DATE[MM DD 2015],
1. New widespread hypermetabolic hepatic metastases.
2. New hypermetabolic upper abdominal nodal lesions probably metastases. 
3. New/recurrent small right perihilar FDG avid foci, consistent with 
malignancy.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Synchronous small cell lung cancer and primary 
squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed 2007. Status post adrenalectomy 2009 for 
small cell cancer recurrence. Subsequent right lower lobe squamous cell 
carcinoma and small cell carcinoma metastases to liver. Post nivolumab.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the pubic symphysis after oral and intravenous contrast 
administration.

node represents a slightly ectatic left subclavian artery, better 
delineated on current contrast-enhanced CT.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              Decrease in size of bilobar hepatic 
metastases, even allowing for differences in contrast technique. For 
example:
*  Segment 8, 1.7 x 1.4 cm, previously 2.9x 2.9 cm
*  Segment 2, 1.8 x 1.5 cm, previously 2.8 x 1.8 cm

**DATE[MM DD 2016]; MRI brain
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2009]
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
There is no mass effect, acute hemorrhage, acute infarct, or suspicious 
intracranial enhancement. Multiple patchy and confluent FLAIR 
hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter and pons have increased and 
are consistent with moderate to marked chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease. The ventricles have increased in size consistent with interval 
generalized parenchymal volume loss; a component of superimposed 
communicating hydrocephalus is not excluded given slightly 
disproportionate increase in ventricle size compared to sulcal dilatation.
 
OTHER:
The patient is status post bilateral intraocular lens implantation. 
Slightly asymmetric thickening of the right nasopharynx is probably 
secondary to reactive change. There has been no change in the appearance 
of the pituitary gland and infundibulum which are not abnormally enlarged 
or thickened.
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM 2009];
No evidence to suggest interval development of brain metastases. 
Incidental findings as above.

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer, non-small cell carcinoma. Evaluate for 
extent of disease.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.8 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18FDG and an 
approximately 60 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 600 PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral contrast material was 
administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed for 
attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 130 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

BONES/SOFT TISSUES:
The position of the partially visualized left upper extremity differs, 
between the PET and CT datasets, limiting evaluation. As the visualized 
hypermetabolic focus in the left proximal humerus again visualized, 
allowing for imprecise PET CT localization due to misregistration; stable 
scintigraphically.
 
Unchanged remaining sclerotic bone lesions in the thoracic spine and 
pelvis with no increased FDG uptake. Consistent with treated disease.
Unchanged healing left posterior fifth rib fracture.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:  None.
 
IMPRESSION:  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015],
1.  Left lower lobe lung nodule; increased size; new hypermetabolic 
activity; consistent with malignant tumor.
2.  Leftmediastinal/pulmonary lymph nodes; increased size; new 
hypermetabolic activity; consistent with metastatic disease.
3.  Hypermetabolic lesion in the proximal region of the left humerus;

**DATE[MM DD 2015] CT of left proximal femur
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer. Evaluate extent of the disease
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical thin sections were obtained from left 
superior acetabular roof to proximal femora diaphysis  with intravenous 
contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 459 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON:  Correlated with PET **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
FINDINGS:
 
BONES:                A 1.9 x 1.8 cm FDG avid left femoral neck lytic 
metastasis occupying half of the diameter of the femoral neck at its 
maximum dimension; it is probably increased in size, sclerotic rim 
although the comparison with PET is limited due to difference in imaging 
modality; there is no associated cortical destruction, periosteal reaction 
or extraosseous extension.
 
Increased size and number of lytic lesions/foci in imaged left pelvis, 
consistent with metastases; for example, a left pubic body lesion measures 
1.3 x 1.2 cm with new focal cortical destruction, previously 0.7 x 0.4 cm 
and a left anterior acetabular lytic lesion measures 1.6 x 1.4 cm with new 
focal cortical destruction, previously 1.4 x 1.1 cm with, and additional 
smaller lytic lesion/foci in the left pubic body, left acetabulum are new.
 
No acute fracture or periosteal reaction.
 
SOFT TISSUES:   None
 
OTHER:                None
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since PET **DATE[MM DD 2015], increased size and peripheral sclerosis of
the left femoral neck lytic metastasis; it may increase the risk for a 
pathologic fracture.
2.  Increased size and number of lytic osseous metastases in the left hip.

**DATE[MM DD 2015] Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer, evaluate response 
following radiation therapy.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.7 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 66 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery-VCT-BAIC 
PET/CT with the patient in the fasted state. Oral     contrast material 
was administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is designed 
for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET abnormalities. 
This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot replace, 
state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging protocols for 
different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 181mg/dl (decreased from 204 
mg/dl following 4 units of NovoLog).
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.
 
COMPARISON FDG PET/CT: **DATE[MM DD 2014]
CORRELATION: CT chest **DATE[MM DD 2015]
 
FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                          Uptake in the region of the left 
masseter muscle which is misregistered making localization difficult; 
probably physiologic muscle uptake. Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain, large salivary glands and oropharynx.
 
NECK:                                    Physiologic FDG uptake is seen 
in neck muscles.
 
CHEST:     Two new subcentimeter FDG avid nodular foci in the inferior 
aspect (SUV 3.4, image 100) and posterior aspect (SUV 2.2, image 95) of 
the left breast.
 
Physiologic FDG avidity is seen in mediastinal blood pool, myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                    New volume loss, bronchiectasis, 
and right upper lobe are mediastinal consolidation, probably sequela of 
radiation therapy. Within the area of consolidation is focal FDG avidity 
with SUV 7.0, previously measuring SUV of 5.8 probably viable tumor. 
Extent of FDG avidity is increased. Multiple mildly FDG avid subcentimeter 
pulmonary nodules seen in the left upper and left lower lobe, and are 
inadequately evaluated by PET. However these nodules are unchanged since 
most recent CT scan, but new from prior PET/CT.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       New new small non-FDG avid pleural effusion has 
developed, but stablesince prior CT chest. Increased FDG avidity seen in 
the right heart, possibly physiologic or possibly radiation related.
 
THORACIC NODES:                No abnormal uptake.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No abnormal uptake. Liver background 
SUV mean 2.4, previously 2.3. Cholelithiasis.
 
SPLEEN:                                    No abnormal uptake.

IMPRESSION:  Since **DATE[MM DD 2014],
1. Increased FDG avidity of right parahilar lung mass, consistent with 
active malignancy. New superimposed radiation-induced changes.
2. Multiple subcentimeter sized pulmonary nodules in the left lung are

BONES/SOFT TISSUES:
Right mediastinal shift, unchanged.
Persistent lytic lesions in the T9-T11 vertebral bodies, better 
appreciatedon prior MRI. In the T10 vertebral body, there is epidural 
extension of lytic lesion with subtle areas of enhancement (series 2, 
image 41).
 
Increased size of soft tissue masses in the right lateral chest, for 
example:
Spanning the right T9-T11 intercostal spaces, measuring 5.4 x 2.2 cm, 
previously 4.2 x 2.5 cm (series 605B, image 128).
Along the superior aspect of the right latissimus dorsi measuring 2.2 x 
1.8 cm, previously 1.6 x 1.6 cm (series 2, image 34).
Ill-defined mass extending through the right medial T12 subcostal space, 
with extension into the right pleural cavity measuring 5.0 x 3.1 cm, 
previously 4.8 x 2.7 cm (series 2, image 40).
These soft tissue masses showed increased FDG avidity on prior PET/CT.
 
LINES/TUBES:                       None.
 
OTHER:                                   None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolus.
2.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2016] , new ground glass opacities in the left lung 
likely reflect an early pneumonia, with etiology including atypical 
pathogens such as fungus in the appropriate clinical setting.
3.  Increased size and number of multiple left lung pulmonary metastases, 
and right lateral chest wall soft tissue masses.
4.  Lytic vertebral body metastases with epidural extension appear 
unchanged.

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 13.2 mCi F-18 FDG.
 
TECHNIQUE: Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 60 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-A PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state. Oral without intravenous contrast 
material was administered. The CT protocol used for this PET/CT study is 
designed for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of PET 
abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to produce, and cannot 
replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with specific imaging 
protocols for different body parts and indications.

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the 
visualized regions of the brain,, orbits and facial region.
Visualized brain appears unremarkable.
Mastoids and visualized sinuses appear clear. Central skull base, 
visualized calvarium and facial bones appear unremarkable.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic activity is noted 
within themajor salivary glands. There is no focal abnormality within 
Waldeyer's ring.
There is moderately intense activity related to the glottis which may be 
secondary to laryngitis or Vocal activity during the incubation phase. 
Morphologically, the glottis appear symmetric and the subglottic airway is 
preserved.
Soft tissue windows demonstrate no neck mass or pathologic appearing 
adenopathy. The thyroid gland appears intrinsically normal.
 
CHEST:                                     Chest level images demonstrate 
volume loss right hemithorax compatible with lobectomy. There is metabolic 
activity related to the distal esophagus compatible with inflammation. The 
max SUV is 2.3 similar to prior examination.
 
LUNGS:                     Left upper lobe noncalcified 
nodule measuring 8.3 x 5.3 has increased compared with previous 5.0 x 5.0 
mm and has metabolic activity equal to blood pool. An accurate, objective 
max SUV cannot be determined because of adjacent musculoskeletal activity. 
The metabolic activity and growth suggest neoplasm.
At the former medial basal segment location there is an ill-defined soft 
tissue mass of attenuation less than muscle measuring approximately 4.3 x 
4.1 cm transverse. This corresponds with the appearance of the CTA chest 
performed **DATE[MM DD 2015].
The majority of this process has metabolic activity just below adjacent 
liver. There is, however, a focus of well-defined metabolic activity along 
the paraspinal margin of this process with estimated dimensions of 1.7 cm 
in length with max SUV 4.8 suspicious for regional recurrence. Given the 
poor conspicuity of this lesion a targeted biopsy under metabolic imaging 
guidance may be productive.
At the right lower hilar remnant there is a focus of metabolic activity 
max SUV 2.8 which corresponds with CT image 112. Activity is greater than 
blood pool and could reflect scarring. Continued surveillance is 
recommended, however.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       No pericardial or left pleural abnormality is 
present.
There is a band of metabolically active pleural thickening with max SUV 
2.4 extending towards the right apex which corresponds with CT image 102. 
This may reflect scarring.
 
THORACIC NODES:                There is no central or left mediastinal 
metabolic activity to suggest nodal metastasis.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     No focal metabolic morphologic 
abnormality has developed within the liver. Liver background SUV mean, as 
a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 2.6 compared with prior 2.4.
 
SPLEEN:                                    Normal size and metabolic 
activity with dimensions of 9.7 x 8.0 cm.
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                No morphologic or metabolic abnormality.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Excreted activity is seen.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  No abnormal uptake.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             Physiologic activity is noted at 
the proximal colon and distal small bowel.
There is a solitary focus of metabolic activity with max SUV 3.1 (decrease 
compared with previous 3.8) which corresponds with theposterior gastric 
wall as shown at position 519.5. Because of differences in scan timing 
between the morphologic or metabolic series peristalsis may be causing 
this to appear to be projecting within the and incorrect space. There is a 
lymph node in this region. The previous scan projects focal activity in 
the transverse colon. This is unlikely to represent an isolated focus of 
metastasis. This is of doubtful significance in the presence of negative 
colonoscopic screening.
 
PELVICORGANS:                     Prostate gland is normal in size with 
no metabolic abnormality. There are calcifications at the central gland.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          Sagittal reformatted images of the spine 
demonstrate decreased metabolic activity within the thoracic vertebral 
bone marrow compatible with an in-portal treatment related to fibrosis. 
There is no vertebral compression fracture or focal suspicious osseous 
activity.
Metabolic activity at the nonfused 6th rib margins demonstrates max SUV 
3.1 which is concordant with nonunion..
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    Scrotal activity appears physiologic.
There is physiologic metabolic activity related to the cervical and conus 
segments of the spinal cord.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since the preoperative examination there is probable local/regional 
recurrence at the medial basilar region of the right lung base.
2.  Probable scarring at the right hilum and right-sided pleura
3.  Enlarging metabolically active left apical nodule.
4.  Indeterminate probable bowel focus of activity related to the 
transverse colon.
5.  Right 6th rib nonunion,

OTHER:                                1.8 x 1.2 cm hypoattenuating lesion 
at junction of hepatic segment 4A and 8 previously measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm. 
Cholelithiasis is present. Borders of a mass within upper pole of left 
kidney are poorly defined secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast 
precluding assessment for size change. There is involvement of the sinus 
fat in upper pole left kidney. There is possible involvement of the left 
renal vein at level of renal hilum. Chest wall port with catheter tip 
terminating in SVC. Pacemaker noted. Coronary artery calcifications are 
present.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2016], slight enlargement of the right lower lobe 
nodule which is suspicious for a metastasis or primary neoplasm.
2.   A lesion identified in the liver which has enlarged, possibly a 
metastasis.
3.  Borders of the lesion in the left kidney are poorly delineated 
secondary to lack of intravenous contrast precluding assessment for size 
change. This is a biopsy-proven ((**DATE[MM DD 2015]) metastasis.

CLINICAL STATEMENT:      NSCLC. Reason For Study:Other -    Patient is 
referred for subsequent treatment strategy.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 11.4 mCi F-18 FDG
 
TECHNIQUE:  Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 65 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 710-BAIC 
PET/CT with the patient in the fasted state.   Oral withoutintravenous 
contrast material was administered for the CT scan. The CT protocol used 
for this PET/CT study is designed for attenuation correction and anatomic 
localization of PET abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to 
produce, and cannot replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with 
specific imaging protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 93 mg/dl.
 
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.

and subpleural right middle lobe nodule status post right upper lobectomy.
 
FINDINGS: Global review of the MIP image demonstrates metabolic activity 
within the liver and at the right lung base not seen on prior examination, 
see details below.
 
HEAD/FACE:                           Physiologic FDG uptake remains 
unremarkable at the brain and orbits.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is 
present in the mucosa of Waldeyer's ring, larynx, and major salivary 
glands.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is 
present in mediastinal blood pool and patchy left myocardium.
 
LUNGS:                                     Left side no abnormal uptake.
Right lung demonstrates the following:
3.6 max SUV corresponds with noncalcified 1.6 x 1.4 cm right lower lobe 
mass at the posterior basal segment image 106.
No metabolic activity subpleural nodule corresponds with CT image 88.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       No abnormal uptake.
 
THORACIC NODES:                No abnormal uptakeabove blood pool.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     On the background of heterogeneous 
uptake throughout the liver. There is a well-circumscribed metabolic focus 
max SUV 5.1 at segment 8 bordering on segment 4A which corresponds with CT 
**DATE[MM DD 2016] and ultrasound image 33 from **DATE[MM DD 2016].
No metabolic activity related to known gallstones.
Liver background SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 
2.1 similar to previous.
 
SPLEEN:   Demonstrates no metabolic 
abnormality or space occupying lesion.
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                Elevated metabolic activity related to 
mildly thickened bilateral adrenal glandsapproaching liver mean activity. 
These have been previously reported as metastatic.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Left side demonstrates elevated 
metabolic activity related to the left upper pole mass max SUV 8.6 versus 
previous 8.7 and reference lower pole parenchyma 7.1.
No abnormal uptake identifiable related to generalized bladder wall 
thickening on the standard or nonattenuation corrected series.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  No abnormal uptake including shotty retroperitoneal 
lymph nodes.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             No focal or segmental abnormality 
or accumulation.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          No abnormal uptake including degenerative 
changes mid cervical levels and at the L2-L3 interspace.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    Scrotal activity appears physiologic.
There is atherosclerosis, diverticulosis and benign calcification of the 
central prostate gland. Dual-lead left chest wall pacemaker in place.
Right chest wall port catheter termination likely at the cavoatrial level
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015] new metabolic activity related to right lower 
lobe nodule without evidence for recurrence at the upper lobe or hilum.
2.  New, solitary metabolic lesion in the liver at the borders of the 
right and left lobe.
3.  Persistent, symmetric, slightly elevated adrenal metabolic activity.
4.  Persistent metabolic lesion upper pole left kidney without evidence 
for significant regional change.
5.  Gallstones without metabolic evidence for inflammation.,

FINDINGS:
 
HEAD/FACE: Evaluation is made of the portion of the head that is within 
the field-of-view.  Note that this is not a dedicated brain PET/CT. The 
brain is partially visualized .    Markedly prominent activity, consistent 
with physiological grey matter uptake, limits evaluation of the brain.
 
NECK:
No soft tissue findings of concern.
 
CHEST:  Also see LUNGS, PLEURA/PERICARDIUM, and THORACIC NODES.
 The tip of a central venous catheter terminates in the right cardiac 
atrium.
Cardiac pacemaker
LUNGS: Note that the low-dose companion CT of this study is optimized for 
attenuation correction and is not optimized for diagnostic evaluation of 
the lungs.
 
Status post right upper lobectomy with hyperinflation of the remaining 
right lung.
 
Hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung nodule, suspicious for malignant 
neoplasm, again visualized.  SUV Max 3.1 previously 3.6.  1.8 x 1.6 cm 
previously 1.6 x 1.5 cm.  Stable.
 
A punctate perifissural nodule in the lateral segment of the right middle 
lobe is stable on companion CT ,  image 87; again PET-negative, noting 
that PET is less sensitive in the subcentimeter range.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:
No findings of concern.
 
THORACIC NODES:
No findings of concern.
 
HEPATOBILIARY: lack of IV contrast and low-dose protocol limit companion 
CT structural evaluation.
*  Hypermetabolic segment 4A/8 nodular lesion, consistent with metastatic 
disease;  SUV Max 5.6 previously 5.1.
*  Hypermetabolic segment IVb nodular lesion, consistent with metastatic 
disease, newly visualized scintigraphically, SUV Max 3.9
 
SPLEEN:
 unremarkable
 
PANCREAS:
 unremarkable
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:
Hypermetabolic left adrenal mass, SUV Max 5.8 previously 3.7;2.6 x 2.3 cm 
previously 2.3 x 1.8 cm. Increased , consistent with metastatic disease.
 
Nonspecific subcentimeter right adrenal nodularity with minimal activity, 
equivalent to background hepatic uptake; stable.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:
Scintigraphically-intense activity from excreted-tracer accumulations 
limits scintigraphic evaluation of renal parenchyma and the urinary tracts.
 
Left kidney again contains a hypermetabolic mass, consistent with 
malignant neoplastic disease , with following features:
*   image 139. On limited companion CT , 6.7 x 4.9 cm previously 5.5 x 4.3 
cm, increased in size. Lack of IV contrast and low-dose protocol limit 
companion CT structural evaluation.
*  SUV Max 6.7 previously 8.7, consistent with viable tumor. Again with  
extensive central photopenicity suggestive of core necrosis.
*  Hypermetabolic tumor extension into medial perinephric soft tissues,  
inseparable from renal vasculature (suspicious for T3B tumor but) lack of 
IVcontrast and low-dose protocol limit companion CT structural 
evaluation.  Dedicated contrast-enhanced renal protocol CT correlation 
advised , if clinically-appropriate , for better anatomic delineation.
*  Involves mid-/upper region  of the leftkidney.  One mid-/upper left 
renal calyx demonstrates new preeminent retention of excreted-tracer,  
image 142 - possibly attributable to a degree of intrarenal urinary flow 
obstruction (though no marked dilatation of the calyx on companion CT ).
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:
No findings of concern.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:
Focal mild activity at the pyloric sphincter,SUVmax 2.7 previously 2.6, 
new scintigraphically compared to **DATE[MM DD 2015]; probably physiological 
variant uptake in sphincter musculature .     No companion CT correlate of 
concern , luminal contours well-opacified by oral contrast.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:
No findings of concern in other pelvic viscera.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:
Evaluation is made of the portionof the skeleton that is within the 
field-of-view.
No osseous lesions suggestive of a metastatic etiology.
Partial resection/separation of a right rib noted.
Sagittal spine reconstruction inspected
 
EXTREMITIES:  Also see BONES/JOINTS and ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES
Evaluation is made of the portions of the extremities that are within the 
field-of-view.

OTHER FINDINGS:
No other findings of note.
 
IMPRESSION:
Since FDG PET/CT **DATE[MM DD 2016],
1.  Hypermetabolic left renal mass, consistent with malignant neoplastic 
disease , previously biopsied **DATE[MM DD 2015].  Increased .
2.  Hypermetabolic left adrenal mass consistent with metastatic disease; 
increased .
3.  Hypermetabolic liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease, 
increased including one newly-visualized lesion.
4.  Hypermetabolic right lower lobe lung nodule, suspicious for viable 
malignant tumor; stable

FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                There is increased left lung 
atelectasis as well as increased basilar consolidation. Previous posterior 
left upper lobe nodule is probably obscured by atelectasis.
Nonspecific, groundglass right upper lobe posterior approximate 1.0 x 0.5 
cm nodule unchanged.
Calcified right lower lobe subpleural probable granuloma unchanged.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: A left pleural effusion with posterior apical 
predominance and loculated component with extension along the major 
fissure shows moderate volume increase.  There is diffuse left pleural 
thickening and enhancement. Areas of subpleural fat infiltration are also 
noted posteriorly and laterally along the chest wall. At the base, the 
pleural thickening appears slightly irregular.
 
No right pleural effusion. Subtle right posterior medial mid chest pleural 
base nodularity appears new measuring 1.2 x 0.4 cm.
Trace pericardial effusion and/or thickening unchanged.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Prevascular 0.9 x 0.7 cm nodeis 
probably unchanged accounting for technical differences. Left infrahilar 
adenopathy versus tumor measuring 1.9 x 1.6 cm in estimation is also 
probably unchanged accounting for technical differences. Ill-defined left 
hilar and suprahilar adenopathy or tumor also unchanged.
 
Few scattered axillary nonenlarged nodes unchanged. Sub-cm left 
supraclavicular nonenlarged nodes noted.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              A superolateral hepatic segment VII 1.4 x 1.0 
cm low density focus possibly measured 0.6 cm in diameter on prior FDG PET 
scan without definite FDG avidity, however this may have been below the 
resolution of PET imaging. This cannot be confirmed as present on imported 
CT chest **DATE[MM DD 2015]. This lesion currentlydoes not measure fluid 
density.

suspiciousosseous lesion.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              Scattered periportal, small 
gastrohepatic and retroperitoneal nonenlarged nodes are overall unchanged 
and nonspecific. No pelvic adenopathy.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Prostate measures 5.1 cm in maximal transverse 
imaging; seminal vesicles are symmetric. Urinary bladder shows physiologic 
distention.
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     Sigmoid diverticulosis is noted. There is no bowel 
obstruction or ascites.

BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Vague left T3 transverse process sclerosis in the 
region of known metastasis is again noted. Slightly better perceived 
rounded sclerosis in the right sacrum is also noted and indeterminate.
Multilevel productive degenerative changes involving the spine, and 
bilateral degenerative changes involving the hips, again noted.
 
OTHER:                               An area of vague subcutaneous fat 
infiltration in the right upper back remains, nonspecific.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2016], increased left pleural effusion with loculated 
components and diffuse pleural enhancement. Areas of vague subpleural fat 
infiltration at the left base suggests possible chest wall involvement.
2.  Previously noted left upper lobe nodule is probably obscured by 
increased atelectasis.
3.  Unchanged left perihilar adenopathy vs. tumor, with slightly increased 
left basilar consolidation, possibly postobstructive, possibly neoplastic.
4.  New subtle right pleural nodular focus in the posterior medial mid 
chest, possibly inflammatory, possibly metastatic.
5.  Better perceived, larger right hepatic lesion, suspicious for 
metastasis.
6.  Unchanged left transverse process T3 sclerotic metastasis, with better 
perceived right sacral sclerotic focus possibly metastatic as well.

appears slightly increased. Representative medial anterior apical 
pleural-based nodule measures 1.5 x 0.6 cm, previously where smooth linear 
thickening measured 1.2 x 0.2 cm.
No right pleural effusion or substantial pericardial effusion.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Scattered prevascular anterior 
mediastinal nodes show slight size increase, for example measuring 1.0 x

unchanged few sigmoid diverticula.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: New lytic osseous left T8 lesion measuring up to 1.7 
cm, with additional smaller right-sided T8 lesion.
Soft tissue stranding along the lateral lower left chest wall is probably 
posttreatment related although fat plane interface between the adjacent 
deeper abnormal thickened pleura and chest wall is not well preserved.
 
OTHER:                               Unchanged atherosclerotic 
calcification. Apparent lipoma abutting the right lateral serratus

MRI brain
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: NSCLC. WHY? EOD
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted anddiffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: PET CT **DATE[MM DD 2015]
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: Punctate focus of enhancement is noted within the right posterior 
temporal/occipital lobe image 13 series 11, image 23 series 9 and image 9 
series 10 without definite associated edema. Finding may represent 
vascular artifact however finding is more suspicious for liver 
metastasis.. Would recommend short-term follow-up MRI for further 
evaluation.
 
3 mm focus of enhancement is noted within the right temporal lobe image 13 
series 11 with associated edema. This focus of enhancement is not seen on 
sagittal or coronal postcontrast images. No restricted diffusion noted 
within the brain parenchyma on DWI sequence to suggest acute ischemia in 
this site or in the remaining brain parenchyma. Finding is worrisome for 
early metastasis versus late subacute infarction with the latter thought 
far less likely.
 
 
 
Scattered foci of the encephalomalacia are noted within the subcortical 
white matter of bilateral cerebral hemispheres for example right middle 
frontal gyrus image 26 series 4, left postcentral gyrus image 25 and 26 
series 4, right middle and superior frontal gyrus junction image 23 series 
4 and left posterior medial occipital lobe image 16 series 4 as well as in 
bilateral basal ganglia, centrum semiovale consistent with prior chronic 
infarctions. Old infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere/vermis 
images 9 through 12 series 4 is also noted.
 
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss is present with mild periventricular 
white matter change. Ventricle size and morphology are within normal 
limits as well as cisterns. No suspicious focal lesions identified within 
the orbital soft tissues, cavernous sinus or **NAME[WWW]'s cave.
 
OTHER: No suspicious focal lesions identified within the calvarium or 
skull base.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Multiple foci of old bilateral cerebral hemisphere as well as left 
cerebellar hemisphere infarctions as described above. No acute infarction 
on current examination.
 
Punctate focus of enhancement in the right posterior temporal/occipital 
lobe seen in all 3 postcontrast imaging planes as well as 3 mm focus of 
enhancement within the right temporal lobe worrisome for early metastases 
although late subacute infarction cannot be entirely excluded. Recommend
close interval follow-up brain MRI without and with intravenous contrast 
for further evaluation.

CT head
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: NSCLC. WHY? EOD
 
TECHNIQUE: CT head without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1, 
using axial images. Sagittal coronal reformations were performed in bone 
algorithm.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 1916.48 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: Forfile brain MRI with contrast **DATE[MM DD 2016]
 
CORRELATION: None..
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:              Examination demonstrates a 1.0 cm enhancing lesion 
within the left posterior paramedian vermis image 22 series 6, image 30 
series 602B and image 66 series 601B with mild to moderate surrounding 
edema. This lesion is in keeping with known posterior fossa metastasis 
seen on **DATE[MM DD 2016] and is not significantly changed.
 
There is uniform thickened enhancement of the main trunk of the left 
cranial nerve V as seen on axial image 9 series 5, image 18 series 6 and 
coronal image 48 series 601B. No additional abnormally enhancing lesions 
identified within the remaining brain parenchyma, leptomeninges or dura to 
suggest additional pathology.
 
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on the noncontrast images. 
Gray-white junction is preserved. Chronic ischemic changes are present 
within the pons unchanged since **DATE6, 2016. Mild to moderate 
periventricular and scattered subcortical and deep white matter changes 
are identified with bilateral basal ganglia chronic lacunar infarctions 
all better seen on brain MRI but not changed. Ventricles are stable in 
size and morphology without evidence of hydrocephalus. There is mild 
diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
 
No suspicious focal lesions identified within the orbital soft tissues or 
cavernous sinus. Densely calcified atherosclerotic plaques are present 
within the cavernous portions of bilateral internal carotid arteries as 
well as bilateral vertebral arteries as they enter foramen magnum.
 
OTHER:             No suspicious expansile lytic or blastic lesions in the 
visualized bony structures. Paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
 
IMPRESSION:
Since Forfile brain MRI with contrast **DATE[MM DD 2016]:
 
Stable 1 cm left posterior paramedian enhancing metastasis within the 
vermis/posterior fossa with mild/moderate surrounding vasogenic edema.
 
Stable uniformly enhancing/thickened main trunk of left cranial nerve V 
without additional enhancing lesions noted within the remaining brain 
parenchyma or leptomeninges. It would be unusual to have focal 
leptomeningeal disease on one nerve root only. Also considered in the 
differential diagnosis would be cranial nerve V schwannoma which is also 
rare and generally not as enhancing on CT. Given that patient has 1 
parenchymal brain metastasis and the left cranial nerve V isdensely 
enhancing, this finding is most in keeping with metastasis along the left 
cranial nerve V. Close surveillance advised.
 
No hydrocephalus or herniation.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] MRI brain with T1 perfusion
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer with known superior cerebellar metastasis 
status post radiation therapy, now with new facial weakness and hearing

TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images; and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images with 3**NAME[M] 
postprocessing performed on an independent workstation.
 
COMPARISON: Outside hospital MRI brain **DATE[MM DD 2016] and head CT **DATE[MM 
DD 2016]
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN: A 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.9 cm enhancing lesion within the left posterior 
paramedian vermis (series 15 image 12, series 13 image 9 and series 14 
image 14) with associated mild surrounding edema not significantly changed 
compared to the MRI brain dated **DATE[MM DD 2016] and the head CT dated 
**DATE[MM DD 2016] allowing for differences in imaging acquisition and plane of 
scanning.
 
Punctate focus of enhancement in the right paramedian frontal lobe 
adjacent to the falx (series 13 image 31 and series 14 image 15) probably 
vasculature and less likely metastasis. A 6 mm focus of enhancement within 
the right temporal lobe (series 15 image 17, series 13 image 17 and series 
14 image 24) is not significantly changed compared to **DATE[MM DD 2016] 
(seen on series 11 image 17), probably representing small metastatic focus 
with vasculature a less likely possibility; recommend attention to this 
region on follow-up imaging.
 
Thereis no acute major vascular territory infarction or shift of normally 
midline structures. Ventricles, sulci and cisterns are within normal 
limits. Periventricular, subcortical and pontine white matter FLAIR 
hyperintensities are nonspecific and likely represent sequelae of chronic 
microangiopathic change.
 
There are unchanged susceptibility foci within the pons probably 
representing prior hemorrhagic foci.
 
OTHER:
Again noted is uniform thickened enhancement of the main trunk of the left 
fifth cranial nerve (series 15 image 10) slightly increased compared to 
**DATE[MM DD 2016]. In the interval since the prior MRI dated **DATE[MM DD 
2016], there is new enhancement within bilateral right greater than left 
internal auditory canals (series 15 image 9).
 
IMPRESSION:
Since outside hospital MRI dated **DATE[MM DD 2016] and head CT dated **DATE[MM] 
7, 2016:
 
 
1. Unchanged left posterior paramedian enhancing metastasis within the 
vermis/superior cerebellum with no significant interval change in 
surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity.
 
 
2. Punctate focus of enhancement in the right paramedian frontal lobe 
adjacent to the falx possibly vasculature versus metastasis. A 6 mm focus 
of enhancement within the right temporal lobe is not significantly changed 
compared to the prior exam probably representing small metastatic focus 
with vasculature a less likely possibility.
Recommend attention to these regions on follow-up imaging.
 
3. Uniform thickening and enhancement of the main trunk of the left 
cranial nerve 5 slightly increased compared to the prior MRI and head CT. 
In the interval since the prior MRI dated **DATE[MM DD 2016] new enhancement 
within bilateral right greater than left internal auditory canals. 
Findings probably represent leptomeningeal/metastatic disease versus less 
likely multifocal schwannomas.
 
Findings were discussed with NP **NAME[WWW VVV] at 9:20 PM on **DATE[MM DD

(series 16 image 10) and the inferior L4 endplate (series 11 image 6), are 
possibly degenerative although small metastases are not excluded and 
follow-up is recommended. There are prominent endplate degenerative 
changes at the opposing L5-S1 endplates. Vertebral body heights are 
preserved without compression deformity. There is no evidence of epidural 
disease or cord compression.
 
No abnormal signal is identified in the spinal cord to suggest edema. The 
tip of the conus is at the L1-2 level. A possible subtle focus of 
enhancement is identified along the posterior aspect of the cord at the C7 
level (series 23 image 8). There are possible small foci of enhancement 
along the posterior aspect of the cord at T4 and T5 (series 22 image 3). 
Nodular enhancing foci involving the cauda equina nerve roots at the 
T12-L3 levels (series 24 image 7) are suspicious for leptomeningeal 
disease.
 
There are multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. Disc osteophyte 
complex at C5-6 possibly impinges the cord. In the lumbar spine there is 
grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4-L5 and L5-S1. At L4-5 anterolisthesis with 
uncovering of the disc and a mild disc bulge result in moderate spinal 
canal stenosis, moderate to severe right without left neural foraminal 
narrowing. At L5-S1 anterolisthesis with uncovering of the disc results in 
moderate spinal canal stenosis, moderate right and mild left neural 
foraminal narrowing.
 
OTHER: Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity. Enlargement of the left adrenal 
gland.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Nodular enhancement along the cauda equina nerve roots is suspicious 
for leptomeningeal disease. Additional possible foci along the cervical 
and thoracic cord as described.
2. Small foci in the C2 and L4 vertebral bodies are possibly degenerative. 
Attention on follow-up is suggested.
3. No vertebral body compression deformity. No cord compression.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] CT head
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Lung cancer staging
 
TECHNIQUE: CT head without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1, 
using axial images.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 2071 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: MRI brain of **DATE[MM DD 2016]
 
CORRELATION: None..
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:              The heterogeneously enhancing nodular lesion involving 
the superior posterior cerebellar vermis best seen on sagittal image 37 
series 602B is slightly smaller measuring 0.8 x 0.8 cm from 0.9 x 0.9 cm. 
Enhancement that was seen in the bilateral internal auditory canals is 
less conspicuous but is somewhat visualized on the right. Enhancement of 
the left trigeminal trunk is stable. Enhancement that was on the right 
superior temporal lobe is not seen. No definite new or increased enhancing 
brain lesions or mass effect.
 
No acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarct, or extra-axial 
collections. Ventricles are stably dilated. No midline shift or downward 
herniation. Areas of patchy white matter lucency bilaterally are stable 
when correlated with the FLAIR sequence on the recent MRI of the brain. 
Calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the bilateral cavernous internal 
carotid and bilateral intracranial vertebral arteries is seen, which can 
be correlated on the recent MRA.
 
OTHER:             Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No 
displaced skull fractures.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Since **DATE[MM DD 2016], slight contraction of the subcentimeter enhancing 
lesion involving the superior vermis. Stable enhancement involving the 
left trigeminal nerve and less conspicuous enhancement in the internal 
auditory canals, though this may be related to differences in technique 
from MRI. No definite new or worsened brain metastases.

TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the lung bases without intravenous contrast administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 171 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2016].
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                 A lobulated 1.9 x 1.4 cm left upper 
lobe mass has enlarged from 0.7 x 2.6 cm. A 1.3 x 1.0 cm spiculated mass 
in the superior segment of the right lower lobe has enlarged from 0.5 x 
0.5 cm. These are consistent with metastatic disease. Endobronchial 
nodules/impaction in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left 
lower lobe are stable, possibly metastatic or infectious in etiology. The 
patient is status post right upper lobectomy and left upper lobe wedge 
resection. Paramediastinal consolidation, consistent with radiation 
change, in the left lung is stable..
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:  No pleural or pericardial effusion. Focal pericardial 
thickening along the right heart border is stable.
 
MEDIASTINUM/
THORACIC NODES:           Although delineation of the supraclavicular 
fossae is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast
right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is seen, suspicious for metastatic 
disease. A subcentimeter left para-aortic lymph node has enlarged, 
suspicious for metastatic disease as well..
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:         The previously seen left adrenal mass is less 
conspicuous. The overall appearance of the left adrenal is less masslike 
than on **DATE[MM DD 2015] PET/CT. New infiltration of the fat around the 
adrenal and by the pancreatic tail and left perinephric space may be 
related to adrenal radiation or lymphangitic obstruction/metastases.. 
Unremarkable right adrenal.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  Degenerative change is seen within the spine. No new 
suspicious focal osseous lesion
 
OTHER:                               New gastrohepatic ligament 
lymphadenopathy. A 2.9 x 1.8 cm portacaval lymph node was previously 
subcentimeter. A 1.4 x 1.1 cm left para-aortic lymph node just below the 
level of the left renal vein was previously subcentimeter. An additional 
para-aortic lymph node has enlarged as well. Subcentimeter retrocaval 
lymph nodes are stable The extent of the abdominal lymphadenopathy is not 
imaged on this chest CT. Periportal edema is identified within the liver. 
A nonobstructing right renal calculus is seen. Right renal cyst.
 
IMPRESSION:
Since **DATE[MM DD 2016]:
1.  Bilateral pulmonary metastases have enlarged.
2.  New right supraclavicular and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy, the 
extent of which is incompletely imaged on this chest CT.
3.   Slight increased infiltration of the left perirenal fascia, left 
perinephric space,  gastrocolic ligament, and pancreatic tail may be 
related to radiation change, lymphatic obstruction, or in the appropriate 
clinical setting pancreatitis. This was discussed with Dr. **PHYS_NAME on **DATE[MM DD 16].

**DATE[MM DD 2015]; MRI brain
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR,T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2015]
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
Thereis no mass effect, acute hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, acute 
infarction, or suspicious intracranial enhancement. Several small and 
incidental developmental venous anomalies are noted, including within the 
high parasagittal right parietal lobe (12,image 10) and more inferior 
right parietal lobe (series 13, image 20). And associated SWI 
hypointensity location possibly represents a cavernoma. Several punctate 
and nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter are 
probably secondary to minor chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
 
OTHER:
There is reactive appearing thickening and cystic change within the 
nasopharynx. There are no expansile or infiltrative marrow lesions to 
suggest osseous metastases in the calvarium and skull base.
 
IMPRESSION:
No evidence to suggest interval development of brain metastases.

**DATE[MM DD 2016] CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Non-small cell lung cancer. Evaluate extent of disease.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the pubic symphysis after oral and intravenous contrast 
administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 1023.13 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: CT scan of the chest **DATE[MM DD 2016] and PET/CT scan **DATE[MM DD 
2016]..
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                       Patient is status post wedge 
resection from within the left upper lobe and right middle lobectomy. 
Within the right hilum at the level of the surgical staple line is soft 
tissue measuring 3.1 x 1.7 cm previously 2.6 x 1.1cm. This was FDG avid 
on the recent PET CT of **DATE[MM DD 2016]. Superior to this is soft tissue 
measuring 2.6 x 2.5 cm previously 3.1 x 2.8 cm. A 0.7 x 0.6 cm right lower 
lobe nodule (series 3 image 31) was 0.6 x 0.5 cm previously. The left 
lower lobe is partially atelectatic with bronchograms within and unchanged 
in position with adjacent surgical clips. There are a few pulmonary 
nodules within the left lung and a few adjacent pleural-based nodules as 
well. The largest pleural-based nodule is 0.5 x 0.3 cm previously 0.4 x 
0.2 cm. Largest left lower lobe nodule is 0.7 x 0.4 cm (series 3 image 34) 
previously 0.6 x 0.6 cm.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Small left pleural effusion is loculated with a few 
gas bubbles within possibly the earliest sign of a bronchopleural fistula 
though infection is possible. No pleural effusion on the right and no 
pericardial effusion.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         There are several tiny left 
supraclavicular nodes, unchanged from prior study. No mediastinal 
adenopathy.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:              No hepatomegaly and no mass or biliary 
dilatation. Gallbladder is unremarkable.
 
SPLEEN:                            Unremarkable.

PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL: No bowel obstruction.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
 
OTHER:                               None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2016] slight increased soft tissue in the right 
perihilar region both superior to and adjacent to a surgical staple line 
in this patient status post right middle lobectomy. This was FDG avid on 
the PET/CT of **DATE[MM DD 2016] and is probably viable tumor.
2.  Densely atelectatic portion of the left lower lobe with air 
bronchograms is unchanged. Scarring in the left upper lobe status post 
left apical segmentectomy is unchanged as well.
3.  Small bilateral pulmonary nodules are either unchanged or slightly 
enlarged. Several of these show mild FDG avidity in the PET CT scan and 
are suspicious for metastases.
4.  Decreased left pleural effusion with small gas bubbles possibly 
secondary to thoracentesis or possibly the earliest signs of a 
bronchopleural fistula, though infection is possible.

**DATE[MM DD 2016]: CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Pancreatic and lung cancer.
 
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the thoracic 
inlet to the pubic symphysis after oral and intravenous contrast 
administration.
 
RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 742 mGy-cm
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2015].
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS:                                Status post left upper lobectomy. 
Overall increased size and number of multiple left lung nodules, many in a 
clustered arrangement, some with a subsolid appearance. For example, 
nodule in the left midlung zone measures 0.9 x 0.7 cm compared to 0.7 x 
0.5 cm. There are new associated multifocal patchy groundglass opacities. 
Confluent masslike opacities in the left lower lung zone are also overall 
increased in size and extent, particularly posterolaterally. Scattered 
subsolid/semisolid masslike and nodular opacities in the right lung 
demonstrate mixed interval changes, some unchanged and some slightly 
increased or decreased in size. For example, irregular subsolid masslike 
opacity in the right upper lobe measures 1.8 x 1.4 cm, unchanged, masslike 
consolidation in the medial right upper lobe measures 2.1 x 1.5 cm 
compared to 2.4 x 1.8 cm, subsolid nodule in the right upper lobe measures 
1.1 x 0.9 cm compared to 0.5 x 0.5 cm and a semisolid right lower lobe 
nodule measures 1.2 x 0.9 cm compared to 1.1 x 0.8 cm.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Unchanged trace left pleural effusion. No right 
pleural or pericardial effusion.
 
MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES:         Unchanged possible mildly prominent 
right superior hilar lymph node. No developing adenopathy.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:           Hepatic steatosis. Increased size of 
geographic area of hypervascularity in segment 6, probably representing 
transient perfusion difference or fatty sparing with new underlying small 
branching lucencies, possibly mildly dilated intrahepatic ducts.
 
SPLEEN:                            Status post splenectomy.
 
PANCREAS:                      Status post distal pancreatectomy with 
resolution of associated small postsurgical fluid collection.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:        Unremarkable.
 
KIDNEYS:                          No hydronephrosis. Bilateral mildly 
prominent extrarenal pelves again noted.
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC
NODES:                              Unchanged borderline prominent 2.1 x 
1.1 cm portacaval lymph node, non-FDG avid on prior PET scan.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:            Unchanged appearance.
 
PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY/BOWEL:     No bowel obstruction or ascites. Colonic 
diverticulosis.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: Degenerative changes of the spine. Small 
hyperattenuated focus again seen in the anterior left abdominal wall 
possibly reflecting postoperative change.
 
OTHER:                               None.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since **DATE[MM DD 2015], increased size and number of multiple left 
lung nodules as well as masslike consolidative opacities in the left lower 
lung zone. Mixed interval changes in scattered right lung nodular and 
masslike opacities, some unchanged and some slightly increased or 
decreased in size. Findings remain suspicious for a multifocal/metastatic 
neoplastic process (more likely of lung than pancreatic origin) but a 
superimposed inflammatory/infectious process is also possible.
2.  Unchanged appearance of distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy surgical bed 
except for resolution of small postsurgical collection.
3.  Increased size of geographic hyperattenuation in hepatic segment 6, 
probably representing focal fatty sparing or transient perfusion 
difference, now with possible underlying mildly prominent intrahepatic 
biliary ducts. Follow-up also recommended.

**DATE[MM DD 2016]; MRI brain
 
CLINICAL DATA: History of lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI brain without and with intravenous contrast, protocol #1. 
Sagittal and axial T1-weighted images; axial susceptibility-weighted, 
FLAIR, T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images; axial ADC and 
exponential ADC maps; and contrast-enhanced coronal, sagittal and axial 
T1-weighted images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: **DATE[MM DD 2015] and **DATE[MM DD 2015]
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
BRAIN:
There is no acute hemorrhage, acute infarction, or hydrocephalus. Multiple 
small and nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter 
are probably secondary to mild/moderate chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease. The postcontrast images demonstrate a new subcortical enhancing 
nodule in the lateral right temporal lobe measuring 4 mm (series 21, image 
13; series 19, image 27; series 20, image 18). Punctate enhancement in the 
superior right frontal gyrus (series 21, image 28) is not identified on 
the sagittal and coronal postcontrast T1-weighted images is possibly 
artifactual/vascular.
 
OTHER:
There is mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses without 
air-fluid levels.
 
IMPRESSION: Since **DATE[MM 2015];
New 4 mm enhancing nodule in the right temporal lobe suspicious for 
metastasis and less likely subacute ischemia; follow-up is recommended. 
Punctate enhancement in the superior frontal gyrus is indeterminate but 
possibly artifactual/vascular.

**DATE[MM DD 2016]; MRI cervical spine
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION: History of lung cancer
 
TECHNIQUE: MRI cervical spine without and with intravenous contrast, 
protocol #13A. Sagittal STIR images; sagittal and axial T1-weighted and 
T2-weighted images; and contrast-enhanced sagittal and axial T1-weighted 
images were obtained.
 
COMPARISON: There are no prior dedicated imaging studies of the cervical 
spine currently available for comparison.
 
CORRELATION: None.
 
FINDINGS:
 
SPINE:
Vertebral body heights and alignment are maintained. There are no 
suspicious expansile or infiltrative marrow abnormalities in the cervical 
spine. The postcontrast images do not demonstrate any abnormal 
intramedullary, leptomeningeal, or epidural enhancement.
 
There is desiccation of the intervertebral discs with mild loss of disc 
height at several levels. There is no significant canal or foraminal 
compromise at C2/C3. Degenerative changes result in slight foraminal 
narrowing at C3/C4 and C4/C5. There is also slight disc bulging at C4/C5 
without substantial canal compromise. A left eccentric disc bulge at C6/C7 
slightly effaces the left ventral thecal sac.
 
OTHER:
Left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is noted with 2 adjacent and enlarged 
nodes measuring up to 26 and 20 mm. There is also a partially imaged 
metastatic left paratracheal node deep to the strap muscles just above the 
plane of the thoracic inlet.
 
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of metastatic disease or high-grade degenerative change 
involving the cervical spine. Metastatic lymph nodes in the lower neck are 
suboptimally evaluated on this nondedicated study but were noted on prior 
CT chest imaging performed on **DATE[MM DD 2016].

**DATE[MM DD 2016] Whole Body FDG PET/CT
 
CLINICAL STATEMENT: Protocol 14-189  Lung, primary CA.  Reason For 
Study:Follow-up;   Patient is referred for subsequent treatment strategy.
 
RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 12.4 mCi F-18 FDG
 
TECHNIQUE:  Following intravenous injection of F-18 FDG and an 
approximately 64 minute uptake period, low-dose CT and PET images from the 
mid skull to the upper thighs were acquired on the Discovery 690-A PET/CT 
with the patient in the fasted state.   Oral without intravenous contrast 
material was administered for the CT scan. The CT protocol used for this 
PET/CT study is designed for attenuation correction and anatomic 
localization of PET abnormalities. This companion CT is not designed to 
produce, and cannot replace, state-of-the-art diagnostic CT scans with 
specific imaging protocols for different body parts and indications.
 
Plasma glucose at the time of this test: 184 mg/dl.
The patient body weight is listed as 71kg decrease compared with previous  
79.4
The standardized uptake values (SUV) are normalized to patient body weight 
and indicate the highest activity concentration (SUVmax) in a given 
disease site.
 
COMPARISON FDG PET/CT: **DATE[MM DD 2016]
 
OTHER STUDIES USED FOR CORRELATION: **DATE[MM DD 2016] CT chest with contrast
 
FINDINGS: Global review of the MIP image demonstrates new splenic 
metabolic lesion despite dramatic improvement in the chest, see details 
below.
 
HEAD/FACE:               Physiologic FDG uptake remains 
unremarkable at the orbits. Brain activity is heterogeneous without focal 
metabolic lesion.
 
NECK:                                       Physiologic FDG uptake is 
present in the mucosa or Waldeyer's ring, major salivary glands and neck 
muscles.
 
CHEST:                                     Physiologic FDG avidity is 
present in mediastinal blood pool.
 
LUNGS:                                     Left side demonstrates no 
metabolic abnormality or significant change.
Right side demonstrates diffuse metabolic activity in the now displaced 
lower lobe primary lesion as well as hilar metabolic activity. The max SUV 
of the displaced lower lobe remnant is barely above background at 1.7. See 
details below regarding the hilum and mediastinum.
 
PLEURA/PERICARDIUM:       There is a new small pericardial effusion 
without metabolic abnormality or evidence for related chamber deformity.
There is a large new right pleural effusion with metabolic activity equal 
to background.
 
THORACIC NODES:                Left hilar metabolic activity remains at 
background.
There is been a partial improvement in nodal activity at the subcarinal or 
mediastinal and hilar stations with the following trend:
2.0 versus 9.0 right hilum.
3.2 versus 13.9 at the subcarinal station.
2.6 versus 11.7 at the R4 lower paratracheal station.
Multiple factors related to the acquisition including decreased scan time, 
interval decrease bodyweight and decreased mean liver SUV combined with 
the possible competitive inhibition of hyperglycemia (versus euglycemia at 
baseline) may be contributing to an overestimation of improvement in the 
chest. I cannot be certain, therefore, that the pleural effusion is not 
malignant.
 
HEPATOBILIARY:                     Hepatic activity is heterogeneous 
without focal abnormal uptake.
Liver background SUV mean, as a reference for comparing FDG studies, is 
2.2 versus previous 2.6
 
SPLEEN:                                    New splenic metabolic lesion 
max SUV 4.84.
 
PANCREAS:                              No abnormal uptake.
 
ADRENAL GLANDS:                Left adrenal gland metabolic activity has 
declined to background. There is no discrete mass. Right adrenal gland 
remains unremarkable.
 
KIDNEYS/URETERS/
BLADDER:                                 Excreted activity appears 
physiologic and unobstructed allowing for dysmorphic left kidney and 
stasis of activityat the distal left ureter which has improved compared 
to prior examination..
 
ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES:  No abnormal uptake.
 
BOWEL/PERITONEUM/
MESENTERY:                             No focal or segmental abnormality 
or accumulation.
 
PELVIC ORGANS:                     No abnormal uptake.
 
BONES/SOFT TISSUES:          No abnormal uptake allowing for age-related 
degenerative changes.
 
OTHER FINDINGS:                    Scrotal activity appears physiologic.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Since prior examination **DATE[MM 2016] new splenic lesion and pleural 
effusion despite metabolic improvement, and to lesser extent morphologic 
improvement in the chest.
2.  New small pericardial effusion.
3.  Decreased metabolic activity in normal-appearing adrenal glands likely 
a stress phenomenon,

persistent masslike consolidation in the infrahilar region, more nodular 
than in comparison to the most recent study. The large central lung mass 
is difficult to measure due to  adjacent consolidated lung and near 
complete collapse of the left upper lobe. There is complete obstruction of

0.8 cm leftward midlineshift as well as subfalcine herniation. Hyperdense 
subcentimeter foci within the left middle frontal gyrus (series 4 image 48 
and left anterior insula (series 4 image 32) probably represent 
mineralization/hemosiderin deposition related to priorinfarcts noted in 
these regions on the **DATE[MM DD 2015] scan. There is no new large volume 
acute intracranial hemorrhage. Asymmetric hyperdensity involving the right 
mandible and mandibular condyle as well as the temporomandibular joint may 
represent degenerative changes however infiltrative tumor remains a less 
likely possibility. Recommend attention to this region on follow-up
